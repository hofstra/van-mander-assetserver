One can make bed\nornaments with it. If you want that the work stays white, it\nis better to mold with plaster instead of flour. It is\ntrue that it is more brittle and firm as well, but one needs to prepare\nit like this: temper it, when it is powdered strong, in a\ngood amount of water so that it is clear, & grind\nit several times a day for fifteen days. Then pour off the\nwater by tilting, and gather the plaster & grind it\nfinely on the marble, & place it in some kind of\nclean lead vessel, so that no dust & dirt falls into\nit, & leave it in the open air & au\nserain for fifteen days with its water, and\nit will become matte, strong, white and light, very suitable for making\na ground for burnished gold. And this, in powder form, you\ncan mix, instead of flour, with tragacanth gum, and your\nwork will be very beautiful. Lacking plaster, you can mix in well\nground chalk or ceruse, & try bole &\nsimilar things. This stucco with the tragacanth gum has\nthe quality, being malleable before being dry, of fitting on either\nround or flat things, as you like.

Then with a plane\nplane which is like a knife with two\nhandles, one works the wood\nroughly from the top, next one passes the joiner's\nplane on it the better to even it.

And one passes a joiners’ plane to even it\nwell, according to the mark.\n\nNext, one glues the two estelles edge to edge and all\naround only as far as the shape of the blade extends & not\nelsewhere. And this is to make the leather or velvet of\nthe scabbard hold.\n\nThen one puts the sword into the estelles. And precisely thus\nthey set it in the scabbard which is all sewn, and rub what is\nglued along the shape of the blade\nwith tallow to make it run into the scabbard.\n\nThe scabbard is made of calf or sheep leather,\nthe calf ones are all in one piece, but not the sheep\nones. But, when the swords are long, one makes them in pieces which are\nsewn between leather & flesh, & then they rub the\nstitching thoroughly with a piece of boxwood to\ncover & even it. From a good calf skin, viii or 9 or\nx scabbards can be taken. A\nworkman can easily make vi a day. If they\nare too thick, one thins them a little with a plane. If the\nskin is hard, one wets it in lightly lukewarm water, and\none does not leave it there for long. Next, the same\nworker who made the woodpiece has to adjust the\nscabbard to be well made. It is true that for common people,\none may well get ones which are ready made, but they are never carried\nas well. When the scabbard is made & sewed with black thread,\none rubs it with a piece of boxwood or with a\ncloth, having daubed it a little in oil. The scabbard of\na good cow is better than any and also costs more, except the\nvelvet kind. Under the velvet one commonly puts plain\ncanvas or a sheep scabbard or a parchment cover. But\nthe best scabbard of all is a waxed scabbard, of either\nvelvet or calf. It is because one covers the wood\nwith thin canvas, which one next waxes, then one covers it\nin velvet or calf.

With this vinegar burning\nbricks shall be extinguished. And the vapor shall be received\nthrough the mouth &\nnostrils. This is to preserve\noneself when one goes into corrupt air: a\ngarment can be thus perfumed & remove\ninfection from it, from a\nroom, house, &c. If you find yourself in a place where\nyou do not have this preparation, carry\nrue &\nberries pestled together, then, according to\nyour need, boil them in vinegar and use as above.Rerum Scoticarum Historia, Georgio\nBucananoauthore Rembertus Dodonæus, Mechliniensis medicus, | De stirpium\nhistoriaDe L'Orme, De l'invention de bien bastir, and other\nworksTelesius, De coloribus,\nVascosanMarbodius, go De lapillis\nprætiosisOttonis episcopi | Frisigensis | Ab\norbe conditoAbbatis | Urspergensis |\nChroniconHieronymus | Mercurialis, |\nVariarum"}}}
