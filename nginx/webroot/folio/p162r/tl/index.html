It can be gathered from the words of <span>Herodotus</span> that the
navigation of the <span>Portuguese</span> was not newly invented by them as
they brag. At the beginning of the first book entitled <span>Clio</span>, he
says that the <span>Phoenicians</span> would come from the <span>Red Sea</span>
by continuous navigation to the <span>coast of Greece</span>, mainly to
<span>Argos</span>, to which they would carry merchandise from
<span>Egypt</span> &amp; from <span>Assyria</span>, which they usually sold out
of within 6 <span>days</span>.</div><div data-layout="middle"><man>
