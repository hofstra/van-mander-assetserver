lightly &amp; then are touched with a <span><span>pinceau</span></span> of
<m>eau-de-vie</m>. And in order that the <span>mold</span>, wet with
<m>water</m>, takes without refusing the <m>oiled</m> thing, one heats
the <m>water</m> well for wetting the sand, for with <m>cold water</m>
it would refuse. Medals are <m>oiled</m> because they are not malleable
&amp; thus could break the <span>mold</span>. And animals, which are
malleable, do not want to be <m>oiled</m>. <m>Hot water</m> should be
<span><span>of such heat that you cannot hold your <span><span>finger</span></span>
there, without feeling strong heat</span></span>. Wet your sand thicker for
flat medals &amp; solids than for <span>lizards</span> &amp; fine things.
Your sand, having set, clean &amp; scrape your <span>mold</span> on one side
&amp; the other &amp; make a notch at the foot &amp; the border of the
medal on the side of the gate, in order that you can take it away
better. Lower also <add>the <span>mold</span>, scraping</add> the surround
of the medal, in order that, from all sides, you can take it away
without it corrupting the <span>mold</span>. Next, make your scorings around
<s>of the</s> the first cast <span>mold</span> <s><span>mes</span></s>,
in order that the second cast joins with it without varying, &amp;
<corr>especially</corr> make a notch at the bottom of the <span>mold</span>
where the head of the molded thing is. Make some also at the sides of
the gate. This done, dip the reverse of the first <span>mold</span> in
<m>water</m>, <m>oil</m> it, &amp; thus it will not be imbibed. Rub
the reverse of the medal with <m>eau-de-vie</m> &amp; secondly cast,
wetting in <m>hot water</m>. If you have molded a medal <span>en
noyau</span>, having made the first cast &amp; this one having set,
outline, with the <span>point of a knife</span>, the surround of the medal,
in order that it is raised on the cast &amp; and not buried in it. Then
having made the second cast, &amp; having opened your <span>mold</span>,
<s>have</s> take away the medal, in one go, with <s>one</s> two
<span>knife points</span> <s><span>q</span></s>, and that one takes it from
the side of the gate &amp; the other from the side of the head, which is
opposite.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

Take care not to <m>oil</m> your medal too much, for if the <m>oil</m>
seeps out, it diverts the sand from becoming smooth &amp; amassing &amp;
makes it wavy &amp; lumpy. One should only touch the middle of the medal
<s>of the <span>p</span></s> with the <span>point of an <m>oiled</m>
<span>pinceau</span></span>, &amp; then spread the <m>oil</m> everywhere.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">


Make especially sure that the gate be the widest you can
<s><span>p</span></s> towards the medal &amp; embraces it well, that the
entrance of the gate is ample, always narrowing towards the medal. Do
not forget also to notch the entrance of the gate.</div><div><i>Continued...</i></div></div></folio></body></html>
