the tail of the sword, what comes next is the ricasso, the rest is
<corr>the</corr> <s><span>c</span></s>blade. The sides are the edge
&amp; the point. Some blades have a sharp <s><span>r</span></s> ridge,
which has one single elevated ridge in the middle &amp; along the whole
length, and are easy to break. The other
<span>blades</span> are called of three edges or three slopes, which do have
a rise in the middle, but it is flat as if it were a sharp ridge, but
flattened, and <s><span>s</span></s> these
ones are the safest. The others <s>are</s> are called fluted, which
are notched in the middle, &amp; when it is
along the whole length, they are just as easy to break as those with
sharp ridges &amp; are more troublesome to furbish because the
<span>fust√©e</span> cannot get in. But one makes one in particular which is
narrow.</div><div data-layout="middle">Of the guard of the sword are the
pommel, the branches of the guard &amp; the
<span><span>pontet</span></span>, which is this
<m>iron</m> strip which closes off the branch which is at the end of the
ricasso to stop thrusts from sliding into the guard. The
<span>rings</span> are these two branches in
half-round which start from the eye of the
guard up to the branch of the <span>pontet</span>. The branch that crosses
the guard is called the <span>body</span>. And this
quillon block, by which the sword
tail enters and to which all the branches
return &amp; are held, is called the <span>eye of the guard</span>.</div><div data-layout="middle">Then follows the <m>wood</m> of the grip which one <m>glues</m>, or
according to the most competent, with <m>gummed wax</m> which is of
<m>wax</m> &amp; <m>pitch</m>, because <m>resin</m> would be too hard.
They heat it lightly, then rub the <m>wood</m> of the grip with it in
order that the tang or the thread takes hold there. Otherwise, if a
<m>thread</m> were to come loose, it would all <s><span>d</span></s>
break immediately. On <span><m>iron wire</m></span> or <span><m><span>dog</span>
skin</m></span>, one also puts <m>glue</m> on
it. The garnishment <s>of</s> which is put on the <m>wood</m>
<s>of</s>, which is of <m>silk</m> or <m>thread</m>, is called the
<span>cord</span>, which is made from two <s>thr</s> or three
<m>threads</m> <s>wisted</s> twined on the <span>spinning wheel</span>,
or 4 if the <m>silk</m> is thin. The slightly thicker cord holds better.
The binding, which is also made of <m>silk</m> at both ends of the
handle, are called the
<span>buttons</span>.</div><div data-layout="middle">Some grips are made of <m>silk</m>, <m><span>dogfish</span>
skin</m>, <m>annealed iron wire</m>,
<m>threads of gold &amp; of fine &amp; false silve</m>r &amp; of
<m>velvet</m>. <m>Iron wire</m> has a lower price &amp; is the most
durable. Next is the grip of <m>silk</m>, if one does not have the
convenience of being close to the <span>sea</span> to procure some
<m><span>dog</span> skin</m>, which is quite
convenient. <s>To</s> The beautiful <m>skin</m> costs fifty or lx
<span><span><span>sous</span></span></span> &amp; 4 or five <span>dozen</span> grips are
made from it. This kind gives a good grip even if the <span>hand</span> is
<span>sweating</span>. To work it, if it is too hard, one soaks it for one
or two <span><span>hours</span></span> in <m>not quite lukewarm
aquafortis</m>, for if it were too hot, it would cook &amp; spoil the
<m>skin</m>. It is sewn with <m>black thread</m>.</div><div id="fig_p094r_1" data-layout="left-middle"><img alt="" classname="inline-figure" src="/bnf-ms-fr-640/figures/p094r_1.png"></div><div><i>Continued...</i></div></div></folio></body></html>
