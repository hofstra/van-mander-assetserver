harder to melt. And since it is neat, one molds with it. And one leaves
it in one half of the <span>frame</span>, &amp; presses it a little so that
it holds better. And next, you will cast in your <span>frame</span> some
<m>solder</m> described above, or another more meltable than <m>fine
tin</m>. And thus, the second medal will melt &amp; mold itself on the
first one without spoiling it. But to make sure this is done right, mix
some <m>lamp black</m> with <m>water</m>, &amp; with a
<span><span>pinceau</span></span>, give a light coat of this to the medal, which
remains in the <span>frame</span>, &amp; leave to dry. Thus it will not
melt.</div><div data-layout="middle">But if you have a medal of <m>copper</m> or <m>silver</m>, you can
leave it in the cast, if you want to cast with <m>lead</m> or
<m>tin</m>. But it is necessary that it be a little hot, for the cold
would make the <m>tin</m> contract.</div><div data-layout="middle"><m>Tin</m> wants to be cast quite hot to come out neat.</div><div data-layout="middle"><rub><m>Soft tin</m></rub>, which is the best for the cast, is the
