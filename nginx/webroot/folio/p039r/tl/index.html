refines it &amp; does not make it brittle. But <m>gold filings</m> are
assembled with <m>borax</m> or, to spare the <m>borax</m>, with
<m>lead</m>, which refines the <m>gold</m> &amp; softens it, for the
<m>saltpeter</m> would make it brittle, which <m>silver</m> does not do.
This is why, to save money, <span>goldsmiths</span> use it to assemble, in
order to spare <m>borax</m>, which costs viii <span><span>sols</span></span> per
<span>ounce</span>, &amp; <m>saltpeter</m> x <span><span>sols</span></span> per
<span>lb</span>.</div><div data-layout="middle">When <span>goldsmiths</span> have thus assembled their <m>silver
filings</m> with <m>saltpeter</m>, a <m>red enamel</m> vitrifies at the
bottom of the <span>crucible</span>. I do not know if the <m>copper</m>
mixed in with the <m>silver</m> is the cause. <rub>Try for
<m>enamel</m></rub>.</div></div><div id="p039r_2"><h2><m><span><span>Pastel</span> woad</span></m></h2><div data-layout="middle">It is grown in <span>Lauragais</span> <span>where the deep soil is so
fertile</span> that if <span>wheat</span> was grown there <span><span>every
year</span></span>, it would lie flat for being too vigorous. This is why
one alternately does <span><span>pastel</span> woad</span> and <span>wheat</span>
there. For the cultivation of <span><span>pastel</span> woad</span>, one works
the soil with <span><m>iron</m> shovels</span>, as <span>gardeners</span> do.
Next, one harrows it with <span>rakes</span>, &amp; breaks it up finely as
for sowing <span>cooking herbs</span>. One commonly sows it <span>on
<span>Saint Anthony</span>'s day in January</span>. One makes eight harvests
of it. The first ones are better. The best <span><span>pastel</span> woad</span>
of <span>Lauragais</span> is the one from <span>Carmail</span> &amp; the one
from <span>Auragne</span>. And sometimes the <span><span>pastel</span> woad</span>
is good <span>in one field &amp; in the one close by it</span> will hardly
have worth. The goodness of the <span><span>pastel</span> woad</span> is known
when, put in the <span>mouth</span>, it gives a <span>taste as of
<m>vinegar</m></span>, or when crumbling &amp; breaking it, it has some
mold-like veins which are as if golden or silver. One assays it in the
<span><span>dyers</span>' vat</span>, and to fill a <span>vat</span> with it, one
needs six <span>balls</span> of it. One dyes several <span>locks</span> of
<m>wool</m>, and if it dyes fifteen times, it is said to be fifteen
<span>florins</span>, if it gives xx dyings, xx <span>florins</span>. The good
kind dyes up to 30 times &amp; commonly up to xxv or 26.</div></div></folio></body></html>
