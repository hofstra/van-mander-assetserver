is appropriate for casting. And to make it run, throw in some <m>sal
ammoniac</m> &amp; when you are ready to cast, put in a little <m>fine
tin</m> &amp; very little. And note that one needs to cast <m>copper</m>
very hot in the <span>mold</span>, which needs to also be inflamed &amp;
entirely red like for <m>gold</m>, <m>silver</m>, <m>latten</m> &amp;
<m>metal</m>. You will recognize that it is hot enough when it is
smooth, thin &amp; shiny like a mirror <s>of <span>cu</span></s> of
<m>steel</m>, newly polished, or like <m>melted silver</m>. Keep it from
the <span>wind</span>, for it will quickly cool. Stop the cast with
<span>tows</span> <s>or</s> to keep it from cooling. <m>Red copper</m>
comes out more neatly than <m>latten</m>, which has <m>strong smoke</m>
that prevents it from running. I molded it <span>en noyau</span> neatly like
the principal one &amp; thin like <m>paper</m>. It is necessary that it
be so hot that it is white &amp; shiny &amp; polished like <m>melted
silver</m> and <add>like a mirror</add>. I cast it in the same sand as
above <span>en noyau</span>.</div><div data-layout="left-top">



<m>Copper</m> and <m>latten</m> are the longest to melt, longer than any
other <m>metal</m>, especially <m>red copper</m>. But also it flows
&amp; comes out very neat, provided that it is cast very hot, that it is
like <m>water</m>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



Removing your <span>mold</span> from the fire, plant it in
<s><span>es</span></s> a <span>brazier</span>, that fills a <span>pot</span> or
a <span>vessel</span>.</div></div><div id="p137r_2"><h2><m><span>Huile tingente</span></m> to make <m>metals</m> run</h2><div data-layout="middle">Take some <m>â˜¿ sublimate of <span>Venice</span></m>,
true &amp; not <m>arsenic sublimate</m>, a <span>pea</span>, <m><span>aes
ustum</span></m>, a <span>pea</span>, <m>sal ammoniac</m>, a <span>pea</span>.
Pulverize everything separately &amp; next mix everything in a
<span><m>glass</m> bottle</span> &amp; put on <m>hot ash</m>. You will see
that everything dissolves like <m>wax</m>, making many colors. Let it
<s>everything</s> set &amp; put a little of it on each
<m><add>melted</add> metal</m> &amp; it will run marvelously.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



<span>Founders of large casts for statues</span> throw in much
<m>tartar</m>, to clean it of its <m>filth</m> &amp; <m>nastiness</m>
&amp; much <m>sal ammoniac</m> to render it thin &amp; neat. And when
they want to cast, they put in much <m>tin</m>. The <span>cold &amp;
humidity</span> strongly disagrees with it, which renders dangerous the
work of the <span>founder</span>, for one only needs a <span>spring of
<m>water</m> in the pit</span> to lose everything.</div></div><div id="p137r_3"><h2><span>Clamps</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">They are made with <span>flat pincers of <m>iron wire</m></span>,
reheated &amp; refolded then beaten at the ends, on the <span>anvil</span>.
When they are thus fine, they are subject to burning, being put often
in the <span>molds</span> for reheating. Therefore use the new ones.</div><div id="fig_p137r_1" data-layout="left-middle"><img alt="" classname="inline-figure" src="/bnf-ms-fr-640/figures/p137r_1.png"></div></div></folio></body></html>
