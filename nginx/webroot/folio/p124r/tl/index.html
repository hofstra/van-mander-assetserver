&amp; come out looking mixed up &amp; <s><span>to</span></s> clumped
together. Starting, one ought to keep it flat with something dessicative
&amp; that makes it firmer. And in this, the most singular thing is
<m><span>wheat</span> oil</m>, with which you will anoint it. Once cast, you
will be able to repair it. The bodies of <span>butterflies</span> and
plants, that have the stem &amp; the leaves that are wooly with some
hair, capricious &amp; downy, need also to be anointed with the same
<m>oil</m>, to keep these hairs laid down; likewise flowers that have
leaves very delicate &amp; thin, for dry <m><span>wheat</span> oil</m> makes
them rigid and firm. And if someone brags about molding what is
presented to them, give them to mold the downy head of the plant called
<span><span>dandelion</span></span> or a <span>pappus</span>, which comes from the
seeds of <span>burdock</span> &amp; flies away at the slightest sigh of
<span>wind</span>.</div></div><div id="p124r_2"><h2><span>Noyaulx</span> for molding hollow</h2><div data-layout="middle">Animals of <m>gold</m> &amp; <m>silver</m> can readily be molded
<s><span>s</span></s> hollow, to avoid weightiness, and costs as well,
if they are not very small. But to make the core &amp; the
<span>noyau</span>, one needs the <span>mold</span> to be freshly molded &amp;
not dry.</div></div><div id="p124r_3"><h2><span>Spider</span>â€™s web</h2><div data-layout="middle">It comes undone in <m>water</m> &amp; thus, cannot be molded in a
<span>noyau</span>, but one casts the <m>spider</m> and then one draws the
drawn threads between the grass that they make <span>in the fields</span>
on some <span><m><span>carton</span></m></span> with a <span>point</span>. One makes
around an edge of <m>paper</m>, <span><m>glued to the
<span>carton</span></m></span> &amp; one casts with <m>tin, very little
alloyed with lead</m>.</div></div><div id="p124r_4"><h2><m>Fine gold</m> </h2><div data-layout="middle">There is a species of <m>gold</m> which, even though it is very fine
&amp; unalloyed &amp; has been passed through <m>aquafortis</m> &amp;
<m>antimony</m>, is however so brittle that it hardly withstands the
<span>hammer</span>. And the composition of <m>verdet</m> described above to
make <m>gold</m> run, makes it as <span>doux</span> as
<m>lead</m>.</div></div></folio></body></html>
