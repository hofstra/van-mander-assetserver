he will not be able to make it fall without lifting his <span>hands</span>
to it, no matter how he shakes his <span>head</span>. And making it seem as

<span>hand</span> &amp; wet your <span>thumb</span> with your
<m><span>saliva</span></m> then press it quite strongly on his

<s><span>au</span></s> another slightly bigger on the inner wall that
will be a little above the spout, just as you can see in the adjacent
example. Then when you want to use it, <corr>put</corr> in <m>wine</m>
or <m>liquid rosette of Brazilwood</m> or <m><span>black cherry</span>
juice</m>, and blocking the hole of the spout <s>the</s> with your

well, making it seem as if you are <span>tasting</span> the <m>wine</m>,
suck &amp; draw in a little <m>air</m>, drinking where the little hole
is. Next, make one of the close <span>bystanders</span> drink the rest of
the <m>wine</m> or cast it aside or let it flow through the tip, but
before, you must have pressed your <span>thumb</span> well over the hole on
the top edge, because in this way, by the compression of <m>air</m>, the
<m>wine</m> will be retained between the double walls. Then with a
<span>bodkin rounded at the tip &amp; that goes into its handle</span>, you

his <span>forehead</span>. Then removing your <span>thumb</span> from over the
hole on the top edge, the <m>air</m>, being free, will make the
