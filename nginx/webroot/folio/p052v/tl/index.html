delicate, one needs to pick it before the <s><span>f<span></span>d</span></s>
seed may be perfectly ripe. For if one waits for the seed to be
perfectly ripe, the foot is so dried by the sun that it is brittle &amp;
breakable. It is true that in this way the seed is reduced by a
third.</div></div><div id="p052v_2"><h2>Colors</h2><div data-layout="middle">If you want to keep them beautiful in <m>gum</m> and such that they
do not lose any of their natural color, put <m>white wine</m>, the
whitest and clearest you can, in a <span>bottle</span> with a little
<m>tragacanth gum</m>. And having <span>stoppered</span> the
<span>bottle</span>, scramble &amp; shake it very strongly together, &amp;
let it rest until the <m>tragacanth</m> is dissolved. Also put in a
little fine-grained <m><span>sel blanc</span></m> to brighten the whole.
Some mix <m>clear water</m> with <m>white wine</m>, and with this
mixture they temper the colors without grinding. And these show very
beautifully on <span>illumination</span> works.</div></div></folio></body></html>
