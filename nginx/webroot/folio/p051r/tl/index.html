engraved piece that you want to counterproof from, then lay <m>white
paper</m> on it &amp; rub very vigorously across the top with a
<span>tooth</span> or the <span>bottom of a <m>glass</m></span> &amp; you will
transfer your stamped piece. It is true that it will be in reverse, but
if you <m>oil</m> your <m>paper</m> with <m><span>spike lavender</span>
<s>&amp;</s><add>or</add> turpentine oil</m>, it will show
<s>reverse</s> the right way around on the other side. Then follow
these lines with a <span>pinceau</span> or a <span>quill</span>, then heat the
<m>paper</m> &amp; the <m>oil</m> will go away &amp; leave your
<m>paper</m> white. And if you want this not to be known, if, by chance,
you borrowed the piece, moisten the <m>paper</m> and the polishing that
the <span>burnisher</span> has made on the back, which shows what has been
done, will not be known. The <m>soap water</m> will turn the piece
yellow, but <m>well-gummed water</m>, which has the same effect, does
not do this. If you want to, for the same effect, make <m>gummed
water</m>, then mix some <m>soap</m> in it &amp; do as is said.</div></div><div id="p051r_2"><h2><span>Cutters of <span>printing plates</span></span></h2><div data-layout="middle">To clean the <span><m>copper</m> plates</span>, or to have worn ones
print better, boil them for four or five <span><span>good hours</span></span>
in a <m><add>good</add> lye</m> <add>with <m>lye</m> which is quite
spent</add>. Then make your <m>ink</m> with some <m><span>linseed</span>
oil</m> &amp; not with <m><span>walnut</span> oil</m> &amp; press with the
<span>rollers</span>. The <span><m>copper</m> plates</span> are sooner made than
<span><m>wood</m> blocks</span>, but they are not so appropriate for
printing promptly. The <m>wood</m> ones are laborious but also will
sooner have printed twenty sheets than the other will have done two. To
carve in <m>wood</m>, the secret is firstly to poach, that is to say to
lay the counterproof or drawn piece onto the <span><m>wood</m> block</span>
&amp; to make sure that the side with the traced line is stuck to the
<m>wood</m>. Once dry, you then gently rub with a <m>moist
handkerchief</m> the back of the <m>paper</m> which, by rubbing, will
become so delicate that almost only the line will remain, which, next,
one follows in cutting the surface. You could do this with historiated
<m>glass</m> &amp; coat with <span>noir dâ€™escaille</span>, to then scrape
&amp; layer your colors on the uncovered area. To make <m>ink</m> for
<span><m>copper</m> plates</span></div><div data-layout="left-middle">

These <span>rollers</span> are good for printing promptly with cut <m><span>cartons</span></m> different kinds of <m>pastes</m>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

One can place the <span>plates</span> among the <span>linens</span> when the
<m>lye</m> is quite fine, or also in a <span>pot</span>.</div><div><i>Continued...</i></div></div></folio></body></html>
