part</span> of <m><span>crocum ferri</span></m>. However its quantity cannot
be harmful, for it is that which receives the <m>gold</m>, &amp; thanks
to which it comes out very neatly. But it is good that your
<m><span>crocum</span></m> will have been previously in the

You could cast well <m>gold</m> in <m>common sand of
<span>goldsmiths</span></m>, should you throw therein some substance that makes it
run. Before the invention of <m><span>crocum</span></m>, one would cast
flowers in <m>silver</m>, but not at all in <m>gold</m>. It has not been
forty <span><span>years</span></span> that one knows this in

<m>Sublimate</m> is commonly employed by <span>goldsmiths</span> for
<m>gold</m>. Some add <m>sulphur</m>, but they &amp; others are wrong,
for <m>sulphur</m> sours, even as it heats. And the <m>sublimate</m> is
agitated, boils and bubbles. It is very good to clean <m>gold</m>
because by its exhalations, it draws everything out as it goes up in
smoke. But to warm <m>gold</m>, &amp; conserve its heat, there is only
the color, which is <m>verdet</m>, <m>sal ammoniac</m>,
<m>saltpeter</m>, &amp; <m>borax</m>. This makes it run &amp; you can
