becomes red hot, for otherwise the <m>metal</m> would spatter &amp;
would not do anything good. And similarly, the <span>noyau</span> on the
inside should be very reheated, &amp; mixed with <m>charcoal
powder</m>.</div></div><div id="p042r_2"><h2><m>Wax</m> for seal and imprint</h2><div data-layout="middle">For the large <m>wax</m> seals, one needs to have <m>tepid water</m>
always ready &amp; <s><span>apre</span></s> to keep your <m>wax</m> in
it. But before, it should have been kneaded between your <span>hands</span>
to render it very even, for otherwise the <m>water</m> that would get in
between would prevent it from coming together. Next, you will imprint
whatever you want and put three or four pieces of <m>paper</m> on, &amp;
with a <span>stick</span> <s>you</s> even &amp; round like a
<span>pestle</span>, you will roll it as if you wanted to polish it, and it
will attach itself to the <m>paper</m>, which will help you lift it off
the <span>mold</span>. Thus you will imprint better than if you dripped it
molten. You can carve the figures &amp; gild them, silver them, &amp;
paint them with <m>colors in varnish</m>, &amp; transfer them onto a
base of <m>glass</m> painted with <m>colors in turpentine &amp;
mastic</m>. And if you want to apply these plates by inlaying, do it
with <m>gum ammoniac </m> mixed with <m>vinegar</m>, and you will have
good <m>glue</m>.</div></div><div id="p042r_3"><h2>For casting in <m>plaster</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">Melt some <m>wax</m>, &amp; with a large <span>brush</span>, coat the
relief of which you want to have the cavity, as if you wanted to paint
it. And a light crust <s>upon which <span>qu</span></s> will be formed,
upon which you will cast <s>you</s> <m>plaster</m>, to give it body
and strength. Next, in the <m>wax</m> cavity, you will also cast your
<m>plaster</m> in order to have your relief, &amp; it will come out very
easily, thanks to the <m>wax</m>. This is done more often for large
pieces in high relief than for others.</div></div></folio></body></html>
