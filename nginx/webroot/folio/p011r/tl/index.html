Some take the most delicate they can &amp; grind it with <m>ceruse</m>,
which binds it, and next prick with an <span>awl</span> in several places
the area they want to paint with <m>azur d’esmail</m>, in order that the
<m>oil</m> enters &amp; leaks in, &amp; <add><span>ne</span></add> does not
cause the <m>azure</m>, which in itself is heavy, to run. Others lay the
panel flat &amp; put down the <m>azure</m> on it, which is also done
<span>à destrempe</span>. The main thing is to grind it well on
<span><m>marble</m></span>, and before that, to have washed it thoroughly.
Some grind it <s>with</s> thoroughly with an <m>egg yolk</m> &amp;
then wash it in five or six <span><tl><m>waters</m></tl></span> and lay it
on not with a <span><span>painceau</span></span>, which would be too soft, but
with a <span><span>broisse</span></span> thoroughly softened &amp; crimped,
&amp; laying it on thickly as if one were putting it down with a
<span>trowel</span>; settling down it evens out and flattens. I have
experienced that grinding <m><span>azur d’esmail</span></m> with <m>egg
yolk</m> &amp; next washing it in several <span><m>waters</m></span> is
good. However, it loses a little of its vividness in the grinding of it.
I have also washed it in several <span><m>waters</m></span> &amp;, when it
had settled a little, I removed the <span><m>water</m></span>, still
<s>q</s> blue, with a <span>sponge</span> and squeezed it into another
<span>vessel</span> <s>thus</s> <add>where it settled, &amp; from the
residue</add> I had the ash, flower and subtlest part of the
<m>azure</m> without grinding it, which is
the best, for in the grinding of it, it loses some of its tint. Those
who make it in <span>Germany</span> compound it like <m>enamel</m>, in large
pieces which they pestle, &amp; pass through several <span>sieves</span>
&amp; wash.</div><div data-layout="middle">To make <m>azures</m> beautiful, they wash or soak them in a
<span><m><span>rock water</span></m></span>, as they call it; it is a
<m>water</m> distilled from mines where <m>azure</m> or <m><span>vert
d'azur</span></m> is found, which distills naturally through the
<span>veins of the mountain</span> or is distilled through an
<span>alembic</span> <s><span>par</span></s> from mineral stones of
<m>azure</m> or <m>copper</m>.</div><div data-layout="middle"><m><add>Azure</add> ash</m> are only good for landscapes because
they die in <m>oil</m>. Only true <m>azure</m> holds on. <m>Azur
d’esmail</m> cannot be worked if it is too coarse. Try it, therefore, on
the <span><span>fingernail</span></span> or the <span><m>oil</m> palette</span>. If
it <s><span></span></s> happens to be sandy, do not grind it except with
the <m>egg yolk</m> or, better yet, wash it in <span><m>clear
water</m></span> &amp; with a <span>sponge</span> remove the <span><m>colored
water</m></span> after it starts to go to the bottom, and in this manner
you will extract the very delicate flower, which will be easy to work
with.</div></div></folio></body></html>
