<span>molds</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">Some <s>mix</s> put <m>quicksilver</m> inside it. But, if it is
a little work, or fine &amp; delicate foliage, that only has
<s>p</s> a slender exit, they make two errors: the first, that
<m>quicksilver</m> by its heaviness can break <s>f</s> some delicate
feature inside when shaken, the other, that some grains will always
linger inside that will make <m>metals</m> sour &amp; hinder the
perfection of the cast. It is true that if it is to empty the
<span>mold</span> of some animal which is thickish &amp; which has big conduits
&amp; passages by which the <m>quicksilver</m> can easily exit, like a
<span>bird</span> or a <span>serpent</span>, one can indeed put in it some
<m>quicksilver</m> <s><span>pou</span></s> to break by shaking the
<m>calcined bones of the animal</m>, because the aforesaid <m>â˜¿</m> will
come out &amp; not remain at all.</div><div data-layout="left-top">

The <span>asparagus</span> stalk is so hard that most often it remains as
<m>charcoal</m>. Because of this, dry it out beforehand, or wet it with
<m>oil of sulfur &amp; turpentine</m>, or cast separately the little
branches &amp; <m>solder</m> them onto a thick stalk drawn through the
<span>wire drawing plate</span>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

If the burnt thing has left some <m>filth</m> or <m>ash</m>, let it cool
a little, &amp; with an <span><m>iron wire</m> wrapped in
<m>cotton</m></span> that can bend according to the cavities that you have
to search out, clean &amp; blow out this defect, or with a <span>soft
brush</span> or a <span>clipped <span>pinceau</span></span>.</div></div><div id="p117v_2"><h2><span>Daisies</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">They can be cast well in <m>gold</m>. But if you want to
<m>enamel</m> them, you have to make them by hand &amp; <m>enamel</m>
them &amp; then attach them. Otherwise, the leaves would be so pressed
together that the <m>enamel</m> would muddle together there. </div></div><div id="p117v_3"><h2>Sand that was used</h2><div data-layout="middle">Do not cast it. But because it is mixed with <m><span>alum de plume</span></m>,
you can use it in the mixture of other things &amp; it can serve in
place of <m>brick</m>.</div></div><div id="p117v_4"><h2>Molding <span>en noyau</span> figures of <m>wax</m> or medals of
<m>lead</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">Rub them with <m>oil</m> with a <span><span>pinceau</span></span>, but let
it be so lightly that your medal is almost rubbed dry &amp; that it
hardly appears to have been anointed. Next, <s><span>destr</span></s> rub
it with <m>eau-de-vie</m> and heat the <m>water</m> with which you will
wet your aforementioned sand, with <m>plaster</m>, <m>brick</m> &amp;
<m>alum</m>, in order that being <s><span>chau</span></s> like lukewarm
when you cast it, the <m>oil</m> will not refuse it, as it does with
<m>cold water</m>, &amp; <add>do not forget when moistening your sand to
always mix in it a little <m>sal ammoniac</m></add>.</div><div data-layout="left-bottom">

Medals mold in such a way very neatly.</div></div><div id="p117v_5"><h2><m>Blood of <span>snakes</span></m></h2><div data-layout="middle">If you need to cut some <span>snake</span> inside the <span>mold</span> to
burn <corr>it</corr>, cut <corr>it</corr> far from the entrance of the
<span>mold</span> in order that no <m>blood</m> remains, for it would
make a crust that afterwards would not be taken away by the same
<m>quicksilver</m> &amp; would remove the imprints from your
<span>mold</span>.</div></div></folio></body></html>
