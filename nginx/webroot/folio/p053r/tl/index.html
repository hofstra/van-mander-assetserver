into the notch of the <span>bolt</span> when red hot, &amp; you will bend it

<m>iron</m> will be so brittle afterwards that it cannot be
forged.</div></div><div id="p053r_3"><h2>Casting of <m>lead</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">One mixes it, according to some, with <span>half</span> <m>tin</m> &amp;
<span>half</span> <m>lead</m> and, to <add>heat</add> <s><span></span></s> it,
one mixes in a little <m>sublimate</m>. It casts well in small sizes in
a <span><m><span>cuttlefish</span> bone</m></span>, provided it is good.</div></div><div id="p053r_4"><h2>Molding of <m>Paper</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">Boil <add>over hot <m>ashes</m></add> some <m>cotton</m> in
<m><span>aquafortis</span></m> mixed with <m>sal ammoniac</m>, like
<m><span>aqua regia</span></m>, and the <m>cotton</m> will become very fine,
like powder. Mix it next it with <m>gummed water</m> &amp; you will cast
very delicately.</div></div><div id="p053r_5"><h2><span>Almond trees</span>, <span>apricots</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">They come in quite straight if one grafts them. And all trees with

<span><span>mericotons</span></span>, <span><span>alberge</span></span>,

I believe that the <m>marrow from the horns of <span>oxen</span></m> or

Note that all <m>brittle metal comes out better than fat</m> ones. Also,
