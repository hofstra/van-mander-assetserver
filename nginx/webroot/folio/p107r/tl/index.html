as heavy as before, and like a moderately thick paste &amp; that it is
not so easy to handle, as when it is liquid. It is a sign that it is
cooked enough, which you will know when it also throws big bubbles or
exhalations in the middle &amp; around, as long as a
<span><span>finger</span></span>. Seeing it in this state, remove it from the
fire for it is heated enough, because if you were to reheat more, it
would be too much &amp; would not set as well. For, when it becomes red
&amp; overheats, it loses its strength &amp; spoils the sand. Leave it
to cool before mixing it within the other sands. And when it is cold,
mix and mold, for as soon as you will use it after its cooking, the
sooner it will set.</div></div><div id="p107r_1"><h2>Catching <span>lizards</span> and <span>snakes</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">Take a <span>stick</span> and attach a <span>string</span> at the end, which
