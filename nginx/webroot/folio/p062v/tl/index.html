<span><span>eye</span></span>, without <span>compass</span> or <span>ruler</span>.
<span>Masters</span> do not allow <span>apprentices</span> to do this.</div><div data-layout="middle">When the priming has been <span>long</span> done, it becomes greasy.
One needs to rub it with <m>ash</m> &amp; <m>water</m>.</div></div><div id="p062v_2"><h2>Perspective</h2><div data-layout="middle">To know the point, one needs to lay down a <span>ruler</span> over the
lines, &amp; at the intersection of these the point will
be. Some make a hole at the end of their
<span>rulers</span> to fix the point by that hole &amp; move the
<span>ruler</span> about. Others lay down a <span>ruler</span> across the panel,
then on this laid-down <span>ruler</span> they set the <span>tip of another
ruler</span>, which, attached to the former by means of a <span>screw</span>,
moves about &amp; reaches as far as necessary without losing the point.
The <span>ruler</span> and <span>compass</span> without the <span>judgement of the
<span>eye</span></span> cause errors. Perspective is very difficult.

To paint perspective in <m>oil</m>, you ought not to use a
<span>ruler</span>, for you would smudge everything. But when layering your
colors you need to keep to <s>the</s> &amp; follow the lines of your
first drawing.</div><div data-layout="middle">Also, to make <span><m>plumb</m> lines</span>, which go from the top
<s>to make</s> <s><span>vif</span></s> to the bottom of the panel,
you need to have a <span><m>thread</m></span> with some piece of <m>lead</m>
attached to one end &amp; a little <span>hook</span> to the other for
hanging the said <span><m>thread</m></span> from the top of the panel.

hold your panel as upright as you can on the <span>easel</span>, for if
it is slanted there is a danger that some dust &amp; dirt might stick on
it. Keep clean &amp; without dust the place where you paint.</div></div></folio></body></html>
