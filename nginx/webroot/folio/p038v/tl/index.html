&amp; you will make a <m>dark brown dye</m>, &amp; reiterating the same
you will make black. Try other colors with <m>lye of lime</m>.</div></div><div id="p038v_2"><h2>Against <md>nose bleeding</md> and for <m>dyeing</m></h2><div data-layout="middle"><span>Pestle</span> some <m><span>sorrel</span></m> or <m><span><span>lapathum
acutum</span></span></m> of the sort that is red-veined, which is called
<m><span>dragon</span>â€™s blood</m>, and apply it <s><span>de</span></s> to
the <md>bleeding person's <span>forehead</span></md>. This herb is a strong
<m>dye</m> &amp; makes beautiful violet.</div></div><div id="p038v_3"><h2>Beautiful <span>artichokes</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">One needs to prune them<span><span>every year</span></span> so that only
one stalk is left, &amp; water them thoroughly. <s><span>L</span></s>
Also replant some <span><span>every year</span></span>, for the second
<span><span>year</span></span> they will bear very beautiful fruit.</div></div><div id="p038v_4"><h2>Planting trees</h2><div data-layout="middle">One says that rarely a tree planted on <span><span>Saint Paul</span>'s
day</span> needs to take, &amp; for covering the bark, <span>cow</span> dung
is very appropriate, for it is not undone in the rain like earth.</div></div><div id="p038v_5"><h2><span>Merchant</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">Those who sell <m>velvet</m> &amp; <s><span>es</span></s> other
stuffs by retail do not make double-entry books because selling by
retail &amp; in detail it would be too much effort for them. They have
only their sales book &amp; their account book. But those who sell in
bulk &amp; those who traffic in <m><span>pastel</span> woad</m> have
double-entry books.</div></div><div id="p038v_6"><h2>Scarlets</h2><div data-layout="middle">Because one <span><span>aulne</span></span> costs seven or eight
<span>lb.</span> to <m>dye</m>, they use <m>cloths</m> worth seven or eight
<span>francs</span> an <span><span>aulne</span></span>. But whoever wants something
beautiful <s><span>se la</span></s> should buy <m>white cloth</m> worth
fifteen <span>francs</span> an <span>aulne</span> &amp; have it <m>dyed</m> with
<m>pure scarlet <span>pastel</span></m> &amp; a little <m>cochineal</m>.
<m>Black cloth</m> comes thin because the <m>dyeing</m> is
inexpensive.</div></div></folio></body></html>
