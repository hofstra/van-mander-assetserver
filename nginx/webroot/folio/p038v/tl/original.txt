one stalk is left, &amp; water them thoroughly. <del><fr>L</fr></del>

<head>Planting trees</head>

<ab>One says that rarely a tree planted on <tmp><pn>Saint Paul</pn>'s
day</tmp> needs to take, &amp; for covering the bark, <al>cow</al> dung

<head><pro>Merchant</pro></head>

<ab>Those who sell <m>velvet</m> &amp; <del><fr>es</fr></del> other
stuffs by retail do not make double-entry books because selling by
retail &amp; in detail it would be too much effort for them. They have
only their sales book &amp; their account book. But those who sell in
bulk &amp; those who traffic in <m><pa>pastel</pa> woad</m> have
double-entry books.</ab>

<head>Scarlets</head>

<ab>Because one <ms><fr>aulne</fr></ms> costs seven or eight
<cn>lb.</cn> to <m>dye</m>, they use <m>cloths</m> worth seven or eight
<cn>francs</cn> an <ms><fr>aulne</fr></ms>. But whoever wants something
beautiful <del><fr>se la</fr></del> should buy <m>white cloth</m> worth
fifteen <cn>francs</cn> an <ms>aulne</ms> &amp; have it <m>dyed</m> with
<m>pure scarlet <pa>pastel</pa></m> &amp; a little <m>cochineal</m>.
<m>Black cloth</m> comes thin because the <m>dyeing</m> is
inexpensive.</ab>
