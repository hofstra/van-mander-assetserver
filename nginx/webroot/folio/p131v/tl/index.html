leaves its quality in the <m>wax</m>, making it melt promptly in the fire
&amp; giving it firmness. In this way, you can melt in the fire this
roughed out <s><span>ci</span></s> figure of <m>wax</m>. But if it is
composed of <m>ceruse</m> or similar things, it is necessary that you
put your <span>mold</span> in <m>boiling water</m>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

For figures of flat <m>wax</m>, there is no need for all this, for the

If your cast work has become porous, it can be repaired with very hard
<m>wax</m> which you can <m>gild</m> afterwards with <m>silver</m> or
<m>gold</m>. To prevent this, if you cast thin, the alloy of one
<span>℥</span> <s><span>d’est</span></s> of <m>lead</m> for
one <span>lb</span> of <m>tin</m> is good. But if you cast with <m>lead</m>
<add>for a thick thing</add>, one needs for one <span>lb</span> of the
latter, two <span>℥</span> of <m>tin</m>, for the
<m>lead</m> being fat &amp; weighty, carries more. From this alloy, I
cast a <span>large lizard</span>, as if natural. In thick things,
<s>if</s> which keep their heat a long time, if there is little
<m>tin</m>, it makes it porous. Your <span>mold</span> must not be cold, but
<span>of such a heat that you can handle without harm, or that you can
keep your <span><span>finger</span></span> in the cast without burning it</span>.
It is also necessary that your <m>lead</m> or <m>tin</m> be like red.
Melt firstly the <m>lead</m>, &amp; then the alloy of <m>tin</m> on top.
And as you want to cast, put a piece of <m>resin</m> &amp; then a
little<m> looking-glass tin</m>. @If you put into the <m>tin</m> too
much <m>lead</m>, it does not run very thin. And to know
<add>this</add>, if <s><span>l</span></s> the <m>tin</m> shouts loudly,
it is a sign there is not enough <m>lead</m>. If it shouts slowly, that
means that is there is too much. Take heed</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

You can <m>solder</m> with the <s><span>l’es</span></s> same substance,
then repair it with the <span>burin</span>, <span>file</span>,

<m>Tin</m> is a <m>metal</m> that penetrates, that becomes porous &amp;
burns, and is fanciful to us, more than <m>gold</m> and

<m>Lead</m> wants not only to be red, but also lively &amp; runny &amp;
liquid as <m>water</m>, which is a sign of its perfect heat &amp; the
<span>mold</span> <s><span>ch</span></s> is <span>so hot that you suffer with
your <span><span>finger</span></span> in it</span>. Do not open until it is
cooled. It is a sign of a good cast, as much for it as for <m>gold</m>
