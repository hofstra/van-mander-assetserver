<span><m>bone</m></span> be on top, thus you <s><span>lâ€™emprand</span></s>
will imprint it without breaking it. If, on the first go, it is not
molded well, return to it several times. Then repair &amp; smooth on the
sides your <s><span>d</span></s> halves of molded <span><m>bone</m></span>.

softest part to the scales. And if your medal does not come out by
itself, scratch the <span><m>bone</m></span> from the back, which is rugged,
and it will release. When you want to cast, secure &amp; join your two
<span><m>bones</m></span> with some <span>small points of <m>wood</m></span>

flowers are not laid on top, but as in air, without touching on any side
anything. <s>&amp;</s> Only the <s><span>es</span></s>
<span>circle</span> &amp; <span>contour</span> are needed, which should be
higher than for <span>flat molds</span>. And thus, take heed to make it
strong and thick according to the size that you want, otherwise it would
burst, the sand being inside. Secure it &amp; fortify it well by the
foot &amp; join well all the joints. Then, take your flower, well joined
&amp; <corr>securely</corr> adapted to the end <s>of
<span>cir</span></s> of the gate of <m>wax</m>, which should not be rough,
but rather smooth, in order that it can release well. Then, wet your
flower or plant in some <m>good eau-de-vie</m>, <s>or else
<span>moin</span></s> placed in a <span>long glass</span></div><div id="fig_p145v_2" data-layout="left-bottom"><img alt="" classname="inline-figure" src="/bnf-ms-fr-640/figures/p145v_2.png"></div><div><i>Continued...</i></div></div><div id="p145v_2"><h2>Flowers</h2><div data-layout="middle">

When you mold them, if they are not strong enough to hold themselves
upright, pass a <span>thread</span> through the <span>mold</span> to keep them
from rising up, &amp; throw the sand little by little, &amp; always blow
strongly in order that it settles everywhere, otherwise it will become
lumpy.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



Because you did not put in this a <span><m>clay</m> slab</span>, the
<span>mold</span> sometimes holds to the <span>table</span> where you cast it.
To undo it, hit a great blow of a <span>hammer</span> at the side of the
<span>table</span>.</div><div data-layout="left-bottom">



It is enough to reheat your <m>luted</m> <span>mold</span> once for flowers

reheat it twice.</div><div data-layout="bottom">
