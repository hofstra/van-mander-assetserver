rise <s><span>par</span></s> when you throw in your clear sand, as to
give them air when the <span>mold</span> is reheated. For, in doing this,
the <s><span>mold</span></s> <add>thread</add> burns &amp; leaves some
empty space around the plants, which serves as vents, &amp; places for
evacuating, &amp; to give air to the plants so that they burn better.
For what makes them stay as <m>charcoal</m> is that they burn in a
closed fire &amp; without empty space because of their fine sprigs. Try,
therefore, to thicken the main stem with a little <m>melted wax</m>
&amp; let it cool, then mold it. And when the <m>wax</m> melts, it airs
it, the principal stem, with space &amp; as if loose, so that it burns
better. Or else, anoint them with <m>oil of <span>petrol</span> or
sulfur</m>, <add><span>de</span></add> <m>turpentine</m>, <m>oil of
brick</m>, &amp; similar things, or <m>aquafortis</m> or
<m>eau-de-vie</m>, or make sands with <m><span>crocum</span></m>, <m>iron
scales</m>, loops of <m>iron</m>, <m>emery</m>, &amp; things that

the <m>wax</m> animal attaches itself &amp; breaks &amp; you would never
