<m>turpentine oil</m>, that is to say a <span><ms>bucket</ms> an
<span>hour</span></span>, and no matter which <m>turpentine it may be,
whether fine or crude</m>. One needs to give, as you know, a little
fire at the beginning. And always keep <m>cold water</m> in the cooler
on the top. The <span>lb</span> is sold at xii <span><span>sols</span></span>, &amp;
at the bottom of the <span>vessel</span> remains the <m>colophony</m>, known
as <m><span>pix graeca</span></m>. In this <span>vessel</span>, <m>eau-de-vie</m> is also made well and there is no need to distill it again. You
do not need a <span>oven</span> for this <span><m>copper</m> vessel</span>, but
only <m>charcoal</m> around it if it has a flat bottom, but if it is
round, you will place it on a <span>trivet</span>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

@ It is better to heat the <m>varnish</m> a little bit, rather than to
put it out <span>in the sun</span>, because this makes the panel
warp.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

@ Some say it is not good to distil in this <span><m>copper</m>
vessel</span> because it is made green. However, when <m>tinned</m>, it is
good.</div></div><div id="p003v_1"><h2>For varnishing</h2><div data-layout="middle"><m>Turpentine varnish</m> does not need any <m>glue</m> because it
is fat and viscous and it is not absorbed in the <m>wood</m> like that
of <m>spike lavender</m> and <m>sandarac</m>. Also, that of <m>spike
lavender</m> does not require any <m>glue</m> on <m>iron</m> &amp;
similar materials that do not absorb, but on <m>wood</m> and on colors
which <s>have</s> <add>do not have</add> <m>gum</m> or <m><span>colle
de destrempe</span></m>, it is necessary to lay one coat of the said
<m><span>colle de retailles</span></m> &amp; to let it dry &amp; to
varnish.</div></div></folio></body></html>
