<head>Sand @ for <m>lead</m></head>

<ab><la>Recipe</la> <m>grey soot from the furnace of the
<pro>silversmiths</pro></m>, <m>quick lime</m>, and
flour,<ms><gk>ana</gk></ms>, moistened according to the art, being the
finest possible.</ab>

<ab>
<margin>left-top</margin>
The <m>grey soot of <pro>locksmiths</pro></m>, which is held in the
<tl>forge</tl>, is very fine once ground, molds very neatly, &amp;
releases very well.</ab>

<head>Sand for <m>copper</m> medals</head>

<ab><la>Recipe</la> <m>hat felt burnt</m> <add>over a covered
fire</add>, <m>dross of iron</m>, &amp; <m>burnt bone</m>, all of which
ground very finely &amp; <tl>pestled</tl> &amp; watered with <m>saltwater</m>;
&amp; make a paste of it &amp; mold it, &amp; wipe it over a
<m>straw</m> fire. <add> @ These three sands, pulverized and very finely
ground on <tl><m>porphyry</m></tl>, mold well, and I think that
separately each of them is very good. <m>Burnt hat felt</m> molds very
neatly and releases very neatly.</add></ab>

<ab>
<margin>left-top</margin>
<m>Plaster</m> molds very neatly but it becomes porous. <m>Bone</m> has
scarcely any body unless it has <m>iron dross</m>. <m>Felt</m> makes it
release. </ab>

<head>Excellent sand</head>

<ab><m>Alabaster calcined</m> in a <tl>crucible</tl> over
<m>charcoal</m> fire, so that, touching it, it turns into powder. Once
cold, pulverise it finely &amp; pass it through a <tl>double sieve</tl>

dry the <tl>mold</tl> in the fire, &amp; cast whatever you wish, while
the sand is hot; &amp; you will cast as neatly as the main one, &amp;
the sand can still be used by placing it in a <env>damp place</env>
