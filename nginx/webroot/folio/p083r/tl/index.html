The <m>grey soot of <span>locksmiths</span></m>, which is held in the

releases very well.</div></div><div id="p083r_2"><h2>Sand for <m>copper</m> medals</h2><div data-layout="middle"><span>Recipe</span> <m>hat felt burnt</m> <add>over a covered

ground very finely &amp; <span>pestled</span> &amp; watered with <m>saltwater</m>;
&amp; make a paste of it &amp; mold it, &amp; wipe it over a
<m>straw</m> fire. <add> @ These three sands, pulverized and very finely
ground on <span><m>porphyry</m></span>, mold well, and I think that
separately each of them is very good. <m>Burnt hat felt</m> molds very
neatly and releases very neatly.</add></div><div data-layout="left-top">

<m>Plaster</m> molds very neatly but it becomes porous. <m>Bone</m> has
scarcely any body unless it has <m>iron dross</m>. <m>Felt</m> makes it

<m>charcoal</m> fire, so that, touching it, it turns into powder. Once
cold, pulverise it finely &amp; pass it through a <span>double sieve</span>
&amp; and render it as if impalpable. And <s><span>d</span></s> with one
<span>lb</span> of <m>alabaster</m>, one needs one

incorporate everything together, then put them in a

place</span>. And with this paste, mold what you will need, &amp; next
dry the <span>mold</span> in the fire, &amp; cast whatever you wish, while
the sand is hot; &amp; you will cast as neatly as the main one, &amp;
the sand can still be used by placing it in a <span>damp place</span>
&amp; drying it in the fire.</div></div></folio></body></html>
