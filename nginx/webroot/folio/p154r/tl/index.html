kept in high heat, especially if there is some <m>lead</m>, for
<m>lead</m> will pierce in the fire a piece with <m>gold</m>, because it
holds closely with <m>â˜¿</m>.</div></div><div id="p154r_2"><h2>Cutting <m>lead</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">Because it is fat &amp; sticks &amp; attacks the <span>knife</span> or
<span>chisel</span>, wet it &amp; you will cut it like <m>glass</m>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">


Sometimes <m>gold</m> &amp;<m>silver</m> take on, through certain smoke,
some color during the casting. But these are not at all scales &amp;
<span>chappe</span>, but rather this color goes aways with <m>whitening</m>
&amp; <span><m>bullitoire</m></span>.</div></div><div id="p154r_3"><h2>Sweetening <m>silver</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">When <span>goldsmiths, who are working with large works</span> have
forged their platters, it very often happens with their sheddings that
it bursts &amp; cracks for being too soured. To avoid this, throw in,
when it is well melted, some <m>dry mortar</m>, composed of sand &amp;
<m>good lime</m> which has been worked, &amp; pulverize it &amp; throw
it in.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

<span>Goldsmiths</span> do not work at all with
<m><span>real</span>silver</m>, that is not alloyed, because it is
<m>leady</m> &amp; when forging it sours.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

Some solder, for small works &amp; things which only go in the fire
once, with some <span>old <span>sol</span></span> &amp; reheated &amp; beaten
<span>carolus</span>. However, if the <span><span>sol</span></span> is not very
good, the <m>solder</m> eats away &amp; one needs to solder on it twice
&amp; there is too much <m>copper</m> on it. Others solder with
<span>half</span> <m>silver</m> &amp; <span>half</span> <m>fine copper</m>.</div></div><div id="p154r_4"><h2><m>Iron scales</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">Once well pulverized &amp; ground on <span><m>marble</m></span> &amp;
mixed with the above-mentioned sand of <span>noyau</span>, and dried slowly
without reheating, it endures several casts of <m>lead</m> &amp;
<m>tin</m>. <m>Copper</m> &amp; <m>latten</m> come out well. But if it
is not well ground, like <m><span>crocum</span></m>, it goes to the bottom,
if the sand is not wetted thickly enough.</div></div><div id="p154r_5"><h2><m>Metal filings</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">They are not made by themselves, if they are not helped with some
portion of similar <m>metal</m>, melted for gathering &amp; putting them
in a <span>bath</span>, for it is sooner burned than melted. <m>Tin and lead
filings</m> are made with <m>tallow</m>, <m>the one of gold</m> with
<m>salpeter</m>, the <m>one of silver</m> with <m>sandever</m>.</div></div></folio></body></html>
