appropriate to make armory, mixing in a little <s>of <span></span></s>
<m>azure</m> if you wish. <m>Charcoal <add>black</add></m> by itself is
as if bluish.</div></div><div id="p059v_2"><h2>Painting of <m>crêpe</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">First one needs to make the background greyish with <m>charcoal
black</m> mixed with <m>lead white</m> &amp; a little <m>azure</m>.
Then, <s><span>resu</span></s> after it is dry, highlight with strokes
&amp; lines in <m>lead white</m>.</div></div><div id="p059v_3"><h2>Folds in clothing</h2><div data-layout="middle">One needs to take care that none are made which are false, but that
only that which the natural can do is imitated. A <m>thick cloth</m>
hardly makes any folds, <m>taffetas</m> &amp; <m>silk cloth</m> make
more, &amp; <m>crêpe</m> more still. <s>Make</s> Observe which ones
should go lengthwise &amp; others across.</div></div><div id="p059v_4"><h2>Desiccative</h2><div data-layout="middle"><m>Lead white</m> &amp; <m>massicot</m> are the most desiccative,
nevertheless they need a good two <span><span>days</span></span>. If you want
to prove whether an <m>oil</m> is desiccative, temper <m>lead white</m>
with it, &amp; if it produces a crust <s>in a
<span><span>day</span></span></s> soon it means that it will dessicate.</div></div><div id="p059v_5"><h2>Double layers</h2><div data-layout="middle"><m>Azures</m>, flesh tones and reds are layered twice. The others
not.</div></div><div id="p059v_6"><h2>Mending the cracks in a panel</h2><div data-layout="middle">If a painted panel breaks you can <m>glue</m> it well on the
reverse, but to fill in the cracks well in order to paint on it &amp;
repair it, it ought not to be with <m>glue </m>, which rots <span>in damp
weather</span> &amp; would swell when touched with the <m>oil</m> of the
painting. But take <m>white wax</m>, which is harder than the other
kind. The <m>oil</m> mixed in among the <m>wax</m> prevents it from
melting <span>in the sun</span>. The <m>wax</m> ought not to be hard, but
soft as if recently cooled. Apply it on cracks &amp; crevices with the
<span>tip of a knife</span>, then scrape.</div><div><i>Continued...</i></div></div></folio></body></html>
