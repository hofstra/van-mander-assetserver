size</span>, which should be hollow on the bottom exterior by about the
<span>width of the back of a <span>knife</span> or more</span>. One of these
will remain empty, &amp; on the bottom of the other you will glue
<m>kernels of <span>grain</span></m> with <m>starch</m> so that it will be
covered entirely with <m><span>grain</span></m>, &amp; it will seem to be
filled with it. Take also a <span><m>wooden</m> bell</span> into which you
will place as much <m><span>grain</span></m> as can be held <span>within the
capacity of one of the bushels</span>, and over the top put a simple
<span>piece of <m>leather</m></span> that fits tightly inside the
<span>bell</span>. Put all into a <span>bag</span> or a <span>napkin</span> or a
<span>folded handkerchief</span>, if you do not want to use a
<span><span>conjuror</span>â€™s pouch</span>. First show the empty
<span>bushel</span>, then in front of the audience fill it with
<m><span>grain</span></m>, then put it back in the <span>napkin</span>. Next,
leave that one there &amp; take the other where the
<s><span>le</span></s> <m><span>grain</span></m> is glued with <m>starch</m>
&amp; it will seem to be the first one, filled with
<m><span>grain</span></m>. Put it under a <span>hat</span> &amp; place the
<span>bel</span>l on the <span>table</span>, gently for the first time. And if
you like, promptly &amp; without stopping, show the bottom which will be
covered with <span><m>white leather</m> of the color of the
<m>wood</m></span>. Then pretending to show the <span>bushel</span> that is
under the <span>hat</span>, you will turn it deftly to the side that is
empty &amp; leave it covered. Then you will command that by
<span>invisibilium</span> the <m><span>grain</span></m> pass into the
<span>bell</span>, which you will have tapped shortly before on the
<span>table</span> a little strongly, &amp; the <m><span>grain</span></m> will
fall to the bottom &amp; cover the <span>piece of <m>leather</m></span>.
Then lift the <span>hat</span>; the <span>bushel</span>
<s><span>semb</span></s>will be found empty and the <span>bell</span> full
of <m><span>grain</span></m>, which you will scrape deftly along with the
<span>piece of <m>leather</m></span>
