possible, &amp; heat it to a little more than tepid. Then take a bunch
of <m><span>weld</span></m>, &amp; take the grain of it &amp; put it into
the said <m>water</m> &amp; boil it
thoroughly, stirring it with a <span>stick</span>, then pour it into a
<span>muid</span> or other <span>vessel</span>, then throw into it two
<span>pecks</span> of <m>salt</m>. </div><div data-layout="middle">Next, take a <span><span>big cauldron</span> of the said
<m><span>river</span> water</m></span> &amp; heat it to a litte more than
tepid. &amp; take three or four <span>double <span>handfuls</span></span> of
<m>fatty red earth</m>, wet it &amp; throw it into the <span>cauldron</span>
with the said <m>water</m>. Take <span>as much <m><span>pigeon</span> dung</m>
as the said <m>earth</m></span>, &amp; <span>as much <m><span>horse</span>
dung</m></span> &amp; <span>as much <m>iron filings</m></span>. &amp; wet the
whole separately, &amp; throw it into the <span>cauldron</span> &amp; leave
it for two or three <span><span>days</span></span>. Then throw it afterwards
into the said <span>muid</span> and stir the whole thoroughly together. And
the older this tempering bath is, the better it will be.</div></div><div id="p056r_2"><h2><m>Varnish</m> for <m>distemper</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">You can make <m>marble</m> by <m>distemper</m> from <m>lake</m> or
<m>rose of <span>Ghent</span></m> &amp; <m>chalk</m>. Once dry, glaze with
<m>lake</m> mixed in <m>wine</m>, for the <m>glue</m> makes it die &amp;
blacken. And all will afterwards appear red, but the <m>varnish</m> you will
put here, which will penetrate, will make dark &amp; light parts appear
as they ought to be. The <m>varnish</m> is made thus, mix with <m>clear
<span>Venice</span> turpentine</m> some <m><span>spike lavender</span> oil</m>
<s>&amp;</s> until all is clear &amp; liquid enough, &amp;it is done
without fire. This one <s><span>es</span></s> is for things in
<m>distemper</m>, and the <m>turpentine varnish</m> that you know, for
panels. <m>Pure <span>spike lavender</span> oil varnish</m> is not good for
panels, for <m><span>spike lavender</span> oil</m> is too penetrating &amp;
makes colours sparkle, unless it was made long ago.</div></div></folio></body></html>
