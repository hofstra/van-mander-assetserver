use a <span>compass</span>, for there is none so fine that it can
<span>compass</span> <span>distances as small as those of the small
cogwheels</span>. But they make a <span>platteforme</span> (as they call it)
of <m>latten</m> <s><span>fais</span></s> divided into several circles,
&amp; each circle is divided into <span>equal distances</span> marked by a
point, and each circle has a certain number of them, for example one 30,
another 36, another 40, &amp;c. Then, on the pierced center of the
<span>platteforme</span>, they set the small cogwheel there, and on the
center of the cogwheel a flat line or alidade which is moved to the
circle with the number that you want to mark on your cogwheel. Then they
draw a line on the cogwheel with a <span>prick</span>, then move the alidade
to the following point, &amp; continue to mark thus. And to mark the
points on the circles of their <span>platteforme</span>, they divide the
circle into three &amp; then divide this <span>third part into as many
distances as is necessary with regard to the total division of the
circle</span>, &amp; make in this manner their division &amp; distribution
of the teeth as fine as they please.</div><div id="fig_p082r_1" data-layout="middle"><img alt="" classname="inline-figure" src="/bnf-ms-fr-640/figures/p082r_1.png"></div></div></folio></body></html>
