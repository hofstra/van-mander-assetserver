<head>For laying down and setting <m>burnished gold</m> and giving red
or green or blue</head>

<ab>

<m>Ceruse</m> &amp; <m>lead white</m> is not appropriate for polished
white nor for burnishing because it is fatty, but it is quite good for
<m>or mat</m> that is made with <m>oil</m> by mixing it with yellow
<m>ochre</m> &amp; <m>mine</m> <del><fr>p</fr>o</del> &amp; by tempering
all of it with <m>oil</m>. And this <m>or mat</m> thus applied keeps
<env>in the rain</env> like <m>gilded leadwork</m> &amp; similar things.
Therefore for <m>burnished gold</m> take <m>good chalk, quite white,
well ground</m>, &amp; soaked with <m>distemper glue</m>, &amp; make
four layers of it, one after the other, on the <m>wood</m>. And once the
last is dry, rub it with <m><pa><fr>prele</fr></pa></m>, which is a
plant otherwise called <m><pa>horsetail</pa></m>, to render it well
polished. Next take <m>fine <pl>Armenian</pl> bole</m> &amp;
<m>sanguine</m>, as much of one as of the other, <m><al>lamb
</al>tallow</m> as large as a <m><pa>bean</pa></m> or a
<m><pa>pea</pa></m> depending on the quantity of <m>bole</m>, and a
little of <m><pa>willow</pa> charcoal</m> or as much as the
<m>tallow</m>, &amp; <ms>half a <pa>walnut</pa> shell</ms> full of
half-burned <m><pa>saffron</pa></m>. Some put in a little <m>candi
sugar</m>. Grind all together with <m>water</m>, &amp; apply it without
<m>gum</m> or <m>glue</m>, &amp; let it dry, &amp; rub the place that
you want to gild with a piece of white <tl>cloth</tl> to better make
even, &amp; when the rubbed place is a little shiny, it is a sign that
the <m>gold</m> will carry itself well. Having rubbed, wash with a clean
<tl><fr>pinceau</fr></tl> soaked in <m>clear water</m> the place that
you want to gild &amp; immediately apply the <m>gold</m>, which you will
burnish once dry. And if you want to lay in <m><fr>rouge clair</fr></m>
&amp; glaze with it <del><fr>de</fr></del>, grind <m><pl>Venice
</pl> <fr>laque platte</fr></m> on <tl><m>marble</m></tl> with
<m><pa>walnut</pa> oil</m> or <m><pa>linseed</pa></m>. Once ground, mix
<m>turpentine varnish or <pa>spike lavender</pa></m> &amp; apply on the
<m>gold</m> with the <tl><fr>pinceau</fr></tl>.
<m><pa>Brazilwood</pa></m> &amp; <m>lake <fr>ronde</fr></m> die. For
green, temper <m>verdigris</m> with <m><pa>walnut oil</pa></m> or
<m><pa>linseed</pa></m> &amp; grind, next mix in <m>turpentine varnish
and not of <pa>spike lavender</pa></m>, which is not suitable for
<m>verdigris</m>. If you want to glaze with <m>azure</m>, it needs to be
set on <m>burnished silver</m> and take <m><fr>azur dâ€™esmail</fr></m>,
&amp;, without grinding, temper it with <m>turpentine varnish</m> &amp;
apply it.
