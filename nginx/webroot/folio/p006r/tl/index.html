or green or blue</h2><div data-layout="middle">

<m>Ceruse</m> &amp; <m>lead white</m> is not appropriate for polished
white nor for burnishing because it is fatty, but it is quite good for
<m>or mat</m> that is made with <m>oil</m> by mixing it with yellow
<m>ochre</m> &amp; <m>mine</m> <s><span>p</span>o</s> &amp; by tempering
all of it with <m>oil</m>. And this <m>or mat</m> thus applied keeps
<span>in the rain</span> like <m>gilded leadwork</m> &amp; similar things.
Therefore for <m>burnished gold</m> take <m>good chalk, quite white,
well ground</m>, &amp; soaked with <m>distemper glue</m>, &amp; make
four layers of it, one after the other, on the <m>wood</m>. And once the
last is dry, rub it with <m><span><span>prele</span></span></m>, which is a
plant otherwise called <m><span>horsetail</span></m>, to render it well
polished. Next take <m>fine <span>Armenian</span> bole</m> &amp;
<m>sanguine</m>, as much of one as of the other, <m><span>lamb
</span>tallow</m> as large as a <m><span>bean</span></m> or a
<m><span>pea</span></m> depending on the quantity of <m>bole</m>, and a
little of <m><span>willow</span> charcoal</m> or as much as the
<m>tallow</m>, &amp; <span>half a <span>walnut</span> shell</span> full of
half-burned <m><span>saffron</span></m>. Some put in a little <m>candi
sugar</m>. Grind all together with <m>water</m>, &amp; apply it without
<m>gum</m> or <m>glue</m>, &amp; let it dry, &amp; rub the place that
you want to gild with a piece of white <span>cloth</span> to better make
even, &amp; when the rubbed place is a little shiny, it is a sign that
the <m>gold</m> will carry itself well. Having rubbed, wash with a clean
<span><span>pinceau</span></span> soaked in <m>clear water</m> the place that
you want to gild &amp; immediately apply the <m>gold</m>, which you will
burnish once dry. And if you want to lay in <m><span>rouge clair</span></m>
&amp; glaze with it <s><span>de</span></s>, grind <m><span>Venice
</span> <span>laque platte</span></m> on <span><m>marble</m></span> with
<m><span>walnut</span> oil</m> or <m><span>linseed</span></m>. Once ground, mix
<m>turpentine varnish or <span>spike lavender</span></m> &amp; apply on the
<m>gold</m> with the <span><span>pinceau</span></span>.
<m><span>Brazilwood</span></m> &amp; <m>lake <span>ronde</span></m> die. For
green, temper <m>verdigris</m> with <m><span>walnut oil</span></m> or
<m><span>linseed</span></m> &amp; grind, next mix in <m>turpentine varnish
and not of <span>spike lavender</span></m>, which is not suitable for
<m>verdigris</m>. If you want to glaze with <m>azure</m>, it needs to be
set on <m>burnished silver</m> and take <m><span>azur dâ€™esmail</span></m>,
&amp;, without grinding, temper it with <m>turpentine varnish</m> &amp;
apply it.
