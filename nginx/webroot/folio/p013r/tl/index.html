<m>agate</m> of various color. But because this total whiteness did not
respond to make this white crust on the surface that I was seeking,
leaving the rest of the thing of its natural color, I made a opening in
a <m>brick</m> of the exact size of the thing &amp; put it inside. Then
I reddened two <span><span>glassworkers'</span>
solders</span>, &amp; as they were red, I
presented them one after the other onto the surface of the thing until I
got the white crust that I required, on which I made such drawing as I
wanted, uncovering up to the red base with a <span><m>diamond</m>
point</span>, and I polished it with <span><m><span>hog</span> bristles</m></span>
and <span><m>tripoli</m></span>. I do not know if it would be better to
reheat it under hot <m>ashes</m>, &amp; if it would be good to encase it
in <m>alabaster</m>, which is very cold, as I encased it in the
<m>brick</m>.</div></div><div id="p013r_1"><h2>Carnation from <m>arsenic</m></h2><div data-layout="middle"><m>Sublimated arsenic</m>, that is to say, the white one that is
