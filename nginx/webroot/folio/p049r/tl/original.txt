<head><m>Casting of lead</m></head>

<ab>Those who cast those small works that are sold in front of
<env>churches</env>, <del><fr>y</fr></del> melt <del>one</del> for one
<ms>lb</ms> of <m>tin</m> half a <ms>pound</ms> of <m>lead</m>, &amp;
cast in <m>stone</m>, &amp; if they want their work whiter, they put
<del>p</del> <ms>half</ms> <m>tin</m> and <ms>half</ms> <m>lead</m>, but
the first mixture is the best, &amp; does not become porous. One needs
to cast it rather hot, for otherwise, it would not flow. Others smoke
their <tl>molds</tl> with a <m>resin candle</m> to cast neatly. The
<m>antimony</m> makes the substance brittle &amp; breakable. The
<m>looking-glass tin</m> makes the work whiter, but not more runny; as
for <m>tin</m>, it is good <del>to the</del> with <m>pure lead</m>.
Those who make very neat <m>lead</m> casts, use <tl>bodkins</tl>.
<pro>Pewterers</pro> cast in a <tl><m>copper</m> mold</tl>. One says
that one makes the <m>lead</m> take hold on the <m>glass</m> with
<m>resin</m>. Some put into the <m>lead</m> a <ms>quarter</ms> of
<m>tin</m>. <m>Looking glass tin </m> renders the work stronger.</ab>

<ab>They put into one <ms>quintal</ms> of <m>fine tin</m> one
<ms>lb</ms> of <m>looking glass tin</m>, which renders the <m>tin</m>
thicker. There are two kinds of <m>tin</m>, one of them nearly like
<m>lead</m>, which runs better, the other brittle, which becomes
thicker. They cast in solid &amp; thick <tl><m>tin</m> molds</tl> or, to
do it more neatly, in <tl><m>copper</m> molds engraved with a
<tl>burin</tl>, or in <m>stone</m>, or in <m>earth</m></tl>. Since
<m>latten</m> shards, mixed in, only render the <m>tin</m> more
breakable &amp; harder &amp; difficult to work with, they cast
<add>in</add> very hot <tl>molds</tl> <del>&amp; almost red</del> &amp;
very hot <m>tin</m>. They fumigate their <tl><m>tin</m> molds</tl> with
<m>resin candles</m>.</ab>

<ab><m>Brittle <del><fr>dou</fr></del> tin</m> is found mixed into
<fr>saulmons</fr>, easy to cut, but difficult to put to use &amp; melt
if it is not mixed with the other <fr>doux</fr> one. And without this,
it would become waste.</ab>
