the first mixture is the best, &amp; does not become porous. One needs

their <span>molds</span> with a <m>resin candle</m> to cast neatly. The
<m>antimony</m> makes the substance brittle &amp; breakable. The
<m>looking-glass tin</m> makes the work whiter, but not more runny; as

Those who make very neat <m>lead</m> casts, use <span>bodkins</span>.
