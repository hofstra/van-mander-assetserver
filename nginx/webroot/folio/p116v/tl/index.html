within the earth, some feed them <s><span>des</span></s> a lot in
<span>barrels filled with <m>earth</m> &amp; covered with
<m>manure</m></span>. Others make several <span>molds</span> <span>in
summer</span>, because with one <span>snake</span>, you can make four or
five. And others mold, lengthwise, a <span>snake</span>, naturally without
it writhing, with <m>common plaster</m>, <add>reheated as said</add>
<s><span>pu</span></s>, <span>en noyau</span> &amp; in two half
<span>molds</span>, as said, then they cast it in <m>wax</m>. In that way
they have <span>snakes</span> that they can twist as they like, and then
they cast them in <m>metal</m>, as is said.</div><div data-layout="left-top">

If, in twisting the <m>snake</m> from <m>wax</m>, some feature becomes
undone, you can repair it by removing the flashing from the molded
<m>wax</m>.</div></div><div id="p116v_2"><h2>Mixture of <m>tin</m> and <m>lead</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">For delicate plants &amp; other flowers or thin foliage, the <m>fine
tin</m> ought to exceed the <m>lead</m> more than three <span>parts</span>.
And if it is a thick &amp; coarse material, the <m>lead</m> ought to
exceed by more than three <span>parts</span>. Heat the mostly <m>tin</m>
mixture, until it is almost red &amp; very hot. And when you want to
cast, in removing your <span>crucible</span> from the fire, throw in two or
three <span>grains</span> of <m>resin</m>, &amp; for one <span>lb &amp; a half
or two</span> of <m>lead</m> or <m>tin</m>, put with the <m>resin</m> as
much <m>looking-glass tin</m> <span>as the size of a <span>hazelnut</span>
with its shell</span>, &amp; mix &amp; cast. And make sure that there is
more of the <m>metal</m> than is needed, in order that some is left.
However, if there is not enough, finish casting, &amp;it will take. But
it will not be so neat. Next, dip your <span>mold</span> into <m>water</m>,
&amp; with a <span>point</span> release it carefully, so that nothing is
spoiled. Make your <span>cast</span> elongated. If the material is very
thin, one needs for it to be almost all <m>tin</m>.

</div><div data-layout="left-middle">
If you <s>mold more</s> want to cast <s>in</s> <m>lead</m> or
<m>tin</m> <span>en noyau</span> in the aforementioned sand, reheat your
<span>mold</span> once, only if there is nothing to burn within. But if it
is for plants, flowers &amp; animals to be burnt, one needs to reheat it
two times, however not as much the second time for <m>lead</m> &amp;
<m>tin</m> as for <m>silver</m> &amp; <m>gold</m>. For for these, they
ought to be red when you cast, but for <m>lead</m> and <m>tin</m>, let
it cool <span>until you can you can hold the <span>tip of your
<span>finger</span></span> in the cast <sn>without burning yourself</sn></span>,
in such a way you find a lukewarm heat. </div></div><div id="p116v_3"><h2>Cast for <m>copper</m> and <m>latten</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">For <m>red copper</m> one needs to put <m>sal ammoniac</m>, which
cleans &amp; purges it of all its crust when it is well melted. There
are some who put in pieces of <s><m>old leather</m></s> thick <m>new
leather</m>. Others <m>parings of the feet of <span>field mice</span></m>.
Others melted <m>common salt</m> alone, or melted with <m>saltpeter</m>.
The principal is <m>sal ammoniac</m> &amp; a little <m>fine tin</m>, as
to what you want to cast. <m>Red copper</m> is more troublesome to melt
<s>M</s> than <m>latten</m>. But when it is well melted it runs
better, especially if it is alloyed <s>dâ€™un</s> with <m>latten</m>.
<m>Latten</m> alloys itself with a <span>quarter</span> of <m>copper</m>,and
one puts it in like in <m>copper</m>. But
particularly, a little <m>calamine</m> makes it run well.</div></div></folio></body></html>
