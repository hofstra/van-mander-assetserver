masterpiece of the <span>masters</span>, for these pieces it is necessary
that they be very precisely hollowed &amp;
adjusted in order that the movement may be free. The bodies of the
cuirass must be very evenly beaten &amp;
driven with a <span>hammer</span>.</div><div data-layout="middle">Morions from <span>Milan</span> are all in one piece &amp; thus better
than those that are of two.</div></div><div id="p032r_2"><h2><span>Painter</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">As soon as the colors of panels are well dried, the <span>Flemish</span>
varnish them so they do not die any further &amp; remain in that
state.</div><div data-layout="middle">The one who knows to work well in <m>distemper</m> will work well in
<m>oil</m>. But, on the contrary, the one who knows how to work well in
<m>oil</m> will not work in <m>distemper</m>.</div></div><div id="p032r_3"><h2>For layering <m>gold</m> in distemper</h2><div data-layout="middle">Common <span>painters</span> &amp; <span>scribes</span> make
<m>batture</m>, which is <m><span>joiner</span>'s glue</m> tempered with
<m>water</m> on the fire, moderately clear, mixed with very little
<m>honey</m>, that is to say a few <span>drops</span> to make it stick, and
with it they form letters, or that which they want to <m>gild</m>,
with a <span><span>pinceau</span></span>, and immediately after layer the
<m>gold</m>, but they never do their work quite neatly, and if there is
a lot of <m>honey</m> it dries only with great difficulty. This layer is
undone <span>in the rain</span>.</div><div data-layout="middle">Others do better, they temper <m>candy sugar</m> in <m>water</m> and
mix it with <m>sanguine</m> that they call
<m><span><span>cocon</span></span></m>, thoroughly ground, adding a little
<m>soap</m>. This is done neatly, &amp; renders <m>gold</m> beautiful if
one uses it as the ground.</div></div></folio></body></html>
