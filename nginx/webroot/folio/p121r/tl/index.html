aquosity, it would rot. It also ought not to be <s>too</s> coarse,
for with its heaviness it would weigh down the flower &amp; make it lose
its form. Having thus chosen it as is needed, take a <span>box</span>, in
which you first make a mound of the said sand, on which you will set the
stalk of your flower <s>so that</s> laid down so that the flower
touches neither the bottom nor the sides of the <span>box</span>, but
remains in the air. Then weigh down the stalk with more <s>on</s>
sand in order that it remains firm &amp; fixed. Finally take some of the
same sand &amp; with two <span><span>fingers</span></span> pulverize &amp; cast
it delicately on the flower, <s>e</s> imitating in that the flow of
an <span><span>hourglass</span></span>. And when the flower is as if
<s>half</s> covered, strike your <span><span>fist</span></span> on the table
where the <span>box</span> is set in order that the sand drops &amp; enters
everywhere. Finally cover it all over and lay thus there other flowers,
in order, one over the other, as many as your <span>box</span> can contain.
That being thus arranged, expose it for <span><span>several
days</span></span>to <span>hot sun</span>. And while the flower dries, the
sand, which ever accompanies it &amp; holds it, does not allow that in
contracting, it shrivels &amp; closes in on itself, rather it is
necessary that it dries in the same state as when you put it there. Now
take heed that you choose for that effect <span>cornflowers</span>,
<span>marigolds</span>, the <span>yellow meadow flowers</span> called
<span><span>ranunculus</span></span> or <span><span>pa<corr>l</corr>ta
lupina</span></span>, <span>amaranth</span> &amp; suchlike, and <span>broom</span>,
and others that your experience will teach you.</div><div data-layout="left-top">



The sand with which <span>goldsmiths</span> buff <m>enamels</m> or the
white one that <span>glassmakers</span> use &amp; any lean sand that does
not hold together, pass it through a <span><m>horsehair</m> sieve</span> for
it ought not be so thin. Next, dry it well in the <span>sun</span> for
<span><span>several days</span></span> to remove all humidity from it, and
ventilate it like <m>grain</m> so that the dust goes away. Once it is
rid of that dust, &amp; well dried, use it as you know.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">
