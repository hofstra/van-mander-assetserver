the back &amp; the front of the cast &amp; having found that they are
rough &amp; firm &amp; hard on one side and the other, which is a good
sign of their being quite dry, I left them to cool. I took some <m>fine
tin</m> <s><span>f</span></s>, one <span>lb</span>, &amp; one <span>ounce</span>
of <m>lead fine &amp; new</m>. I melted it in a <span>crucible</span> until
it was <s>a little</s> like a bit red. Being in this way quite hot
<s>I smoked &amp; not p</s> &amp; being ready to cast &amp; not
before, I smoked with the <m>smoke of a <span>tallow candle</span></m> all
sides of my <span>frames</span> &amp; imprints &amp; cast &amp; everything.
I set my <span>frame</span>, well joined, in the <span>press</span>. I drew my
<span>crucible</span> from the fire. I left it a bit <s>pass</s> so that
the redness at the bottom of the <span>crucible</span> could <add>die
down</add>. And wanting to cast, I threw in two or three
<span>grains</span>, like <m>pitch rosin</m>, &amp; when &amp; when the
<span>size of a <span>bean</span></span> of <m>looking-glass tin</m> &amp; I
mixed, &amp; stirred a little the <span>crucible</span>, and I cast. And the
medal came out as neat as the original. I smoked it with the
<span><m>candle</m></span> &amp; cleaned it with <span>small
brushes</span>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

Always cast through the foot of the medal because the head, which is
lower, will come out better, &amp; make the cast longish. And when you
will cast in a <span>large frame</span> several medals, they will come out
better.</div></div><div id="p119r_1"><h2>Advice about the above</h2><div data-layout="middle"><span><m>Good tin</m></span> is that which is hard as <m>silver</m>
&amp; soft nevertheless. If your work is thin, it must be almost all
<m>tin</m> &amp; alloyed as is said.</div><div data-layout="middle"><m>Looking-glass tin</m> must not be <s>smoked</s> mixed until
the instant that you want to cast.</div><div data-layout="middle"> Nor must the forms be smoked until then.</div><div data-layout="middle"> If the sand shrinks in the <span>frame</span>, this means that it must
be reheated &amp; reddened on the fire.</div><div data-layout="middle">Good sand when moistened does not stick at all to the
<span><span>hand</span></span> when pressed.</div><div data-layout="middle">The perfect sand for the <span>frame</span> is
<m><span>aspalt</span></m> which is found in
<span>Germany</span>, which is soft as <m>flour</m> <s>&amp; almo</s>
when wet, and almost all the others are lumpy.</div><div data-layout="middle">

<rub><span>Nota</span></rub> that the cast must be thin &amp; hardly thick
in order that it does not overtax the material at all, and must not
exceed the <span>thickness of the width of a <m>grain of
<span>wheat</span></m></span>, likewise for <m>tin</m>, that wants to be cast
very thinly. For <m>lead</m>, a little thicker. There is no need to make
the vents very large &amp; deep either.</div><div data-layout="middle">
For <span>frames</span>, the sand that you use for the <span>noyau</span> of the
composition aforementioned is excellent. But in washing, crushing &amp;
reheating it several times, it must be corrupted from its nature &amp;
so that it will no longer be fit to grip &amp; for molding <span>en
noyau</span>.</div></div></folio></body></html>
