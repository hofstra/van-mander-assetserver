&amp;c.</h2><div data-layout="middle">Take <m><span>linseed</span> oil</m> or more cheaply, <m><span>walnut</span>
oil</m>, and rid it of grease with <m><span>garlic</span></m> &amp;
<s><m><span>onions</span></m></s> <add><mark>+</mark><m><span>hog's
fennel</span></m> some also add <m>bread crusts</m></add>, which you will
boil in it for <span><span>a good quarter of an hour</span></span>. Next, put
in one <span>lb</span> of the <m>oil</m> thus boiled a piece of <m>black
pitch</m> <span>the size of a <span>walnut</span></span> &amp; a <span>double
<span>handful</span></span> of <m><span>grains of wheat </span></m>, without
removing the <m><span>garlic</span></m> &amp; <m><span>onions</span></m> and let
it boil together for <span><span>a good quarter of an hour</span></span>. And
when the <m>pitch</m> is well melted &amp; when the <m>oil</m> has body,
you can remove it from the fire. Then, to varnish, place your
<m>iron</m> over a low <m>charcoal</m> fire &amp; apply your
<m>varnish</m> with a <span>feather</span> or a <span><span>brosse</span></span>.
And when you see that it no longer smokes, it is done and your
<m>varnish</m> is dry.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

For excellent <m>black varnish</m>, add two or three <span>paternoster
beads</span> of <m>jet</m> among the rest.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

Some consider <m><span>walnut</span> oil</m> better.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

If there is a lot of <m>varnish</m>, it needs to boil for at least
<span><span>half a day</span></span>, for it is better the more it boils. It
is dangerous if the fire catches within, if it goes over the top, and is
hard to extinguish. Make this therefore in a <span>courtyard</span> or an
<span>open space</span>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

In five or six <span>lb</span> of <m>oil</m>, one must put one <span>lb</span>
of <m>galipot</m>, which costs 4 <span><span>sols</span></span>, &amp; some
<m>peeled <span>garlic</span> cloves</m>. This <m>varnish</m> in and of
itself is not black, but it blackens over the fire.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

See below, around the 3rd part of this book,
after sands, in the chapter on <span>furbishers</span>.</div></div><div id="p004v_2"><h2><m>Black varnish</m> without fire, without disassembling the
harnesses or removing the bands from
trunks</h2><div data-layout="middle">Take <m>varnish of <span>spike lavender</span> oil</m> &amp; mix it with
<m>soot black</m> or <m>lampblack</m>, &amp; without fire it will mix in
by itself. Varnish with a <span><span>brosse</span></span> &amp; it will soon be
dry. <m>Turpentine varnish</m> will be quite good, but it does not dry
as soon.</div></div><div id="p004v_3"><h2><m>Varnish of <span>iron etchers</span></m></h2><div data-layout="middle">Take <m><span>linseed</span> oil</m> or <m><span>walnut</span> oil</m>
&amp;, in place of <m>black pitch</m>, you will put in a little
<m>resin</m>, &amp; it needs to be cooked in the fashion of <m>black
varnish</m> on fire. And for applying it, heat your <m>iron</m> &amp;
give it only one layer of <m>varnish</m>, &amp; when it no longer
smokes, it is dry. Next engrave with a <span><m>steel</m> point</span>
whatever you want. Next <add>take</add> <m>salt</m> &amp;
<m>verdigris</m> &amp; soak as much of one as of the other in <m>quite
strong vinegar</m> &amp; leave it for XX4 <span><span>hours</span></span>
before using it, &amp; all will be soaked. Next spread some of this
liqueur or sauce on the engraved object with a <span>sponge</span></div><div><i>Continued...</i></div></div></folio></body></html>
