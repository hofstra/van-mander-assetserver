to, in order to make an excellent work, take it fresh, which has been
used. For it dries out after having been cast several times &amp; is
lean &amp; has no body. If you cast some fine work which has hardly any
thickness, it is necessary that your substance of <m>copper</m> be very
hot so that it penetrates &amp; runs. Some mix in <m>lead</m> with the
<span>fonte</span>, but it is for large works &amp; not for small ones.</div><div data-layout="middle"><m>Sand from <span>oxen</span> feet twice-burned &amp; finely ground</m>
melts more neatly with <m>copper</m>, &amp; without a <span>chappe</span>,
than sand that I have seen. I have cast a high relief medal with it, and
<s><span>f</span></s> with a thickness as delicate as a <span>knife</span>
blade or a <span>card</span>. And being a hollow on one side, opposite the
relief which was on other side.</div><div data-layout="middle">It is necessary that <m>lean sands</m> be more moistened than
others, namely with <m>magistra</m> or good <m>pure wine</m> or
<m>boiled wine with <span>elm tree</span> roots</m> &amp; similar things.
But <m>very fine sands</m>, like <m>burned linen</m> which is fat &amp;
soft on its own, want to be applied dry.</div><div data-layout="middle">All moistened sand wants to be very beaten &amp; stirred in order to
be ground finely \&amp; to flatten out the clods that it makes in itself
when it is bathed.</div><div data-layout="middle">The <m><span>olive</span> oil</m> that some mix in with <m>beaten egg
white</m> makes it become porous.</div><div data-layout="middle"><m>Sand of calcined glass</m> withstands several castings, but there
are only the first ones. It also becomes porous.</div><div data-layout="middle"><m>Latten</m> comes out on its own, but it runs too quickly. It is
good to mix it with a little <m>copper</m>, like a <span>quarter
part</span>, with the <m>substance of skillets</m>.</div><div data-layout="middle"><span>Founders</span> do cast <span>frames</span> up to 30 or 40 <span>lb</span>,
but not more.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

It is good for big work, but for small ones it is troublesome for
releasing. <s><span>Il</span></s> because it crumbles. It is good that
it be alloyed with some fat thing which has bond such as <m>molded
tripoly</m> or <s><span>ab</span></s> <m>burned felt</m> or <m>sal
ammoniac</m> or <m>tripoly</m> &amp; similar things.</div><div><i>Continued...</i></div></div></folio></body></html>
