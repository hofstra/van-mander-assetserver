<ab>There is nothing better than the black varnish of

because it dries immediately &amp; makes the <m>gold</m> appear very
beautiful.</ab>

<head>For <tl><m>diamond</m> points</tl> for engraving</head>

<ab>These are for tracing what you want to draw on <m>stones</m> &amp;
engraving, &amp; when these <tl>points</tl> are fatty &amp; cannot bite,
one needs to rub them <m>diamond</m> against <m>diamond</m>. One rubs
them with <del>diamond</del> <tl><m>pumice stone powder</m></tl>. One
needs also to unpolish on a <tl><m>lead</m> wheel</tl> either the
<m>stone</m> or the <m>glass</m> on which you want to engrave, for the
polish, which is like <m>varnish</m> on <m>glass</m>, prevents the
<m>diamond</m> or <m>sapphire</m> from biting well. <del>But</del> This
is why it does not bite easily on the <m><bp>nail</bp></m>, which is
polished &amp; fatty. But when the polish is taken off, it bites
easily.</ab></div>

<del><fr>ter</fr></del> it well, rubbing it with a <tl>piece of
<m>leather</m></tl> <del><fr>en tour</fr></del> on the flesh side while
spinning the <tl>wheel</tl>, if you have not worked on it in a long
time.</ab></div>
