The average weighs 18 <span><span>quintals</span></span> &amp;
measures xii <span><span>pans</span></span> long.
Its ball weighs eight or 9 <span>lb</span> &amp; its charge is six
<span>pounds</span> of <m>powder</m>. <s>And for</s> At the breech it
carries a <span>thickness of three balls</span>, &amp; in front, two. It is
more appropriate for the defense of a <span>city</span> than for battery.
However, one takes it sometimes either to break a <span>barricade</span>
or to support the battery after the cannons have fired, in order to
prevent the assailed from re-fortifying after the cannons have played or
fired. Four <span>horses</span> can draw it. It shoots at point blank eight
or nine hundred <span><span>pas</span></span> &amp; almost as much as the
<span>bastarde</span>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



To cannons &amp; large pieces one gives<s><span>n</span></s> as much
<m>powder</m> as is the <span>diameter of a ball &amp; a half</span>, to
which dimension the escutcheon comes. To medium pieces, such as
field pieces, &amp; smaller ones, one gives them powder the
<span>thickness of two balls</span>. To the passe-volant &amp; other smaller
ones, one gives them <m>powder</m> the <span>thickness of three
balls</span>. In general, one charges all pieces <span>up to the
escutcheon</span>. One charges with the <span>ladle</span> all
pieces from the cannon to the piece of four <span>quintals</span>
<s><span>de char</span></s>, and one gives to them two
<span><span>ladles</span></span> of <m>cannon powder</m> or one &amp; a half
of <m>arquebus powder</m>. To smaller ones, one only gives one
<span><span>ladle</span></span>, &amp; those of one <span>quintal</span> are
charged with a small charge.</div><div data-layout="middle">

A field piece weighs ten or twelve <span>quintals</span> &amp; is ten
<span><span>pan</span></span> long or 12. Its ball weighs vi or vii <span>lb</span>
&amp; its charge is 4 <span>lb</span> of <m>powder</m>. At the breech it has
three balls &amp; two in front, as do all pieces that are smaller than
the average. One gives them more of a breech because one makes them
longer in proportion, and also because in a <span>house or
elsewhere</span> one fires them more frequently than the large pieces.
Their <span>caliber</span> is also small, which makes the breech 3 balls
thick. They are used for following a camp promptly &amp; for the defense
of <span>cities</span> &amp; <span>houses</span>, putting them on the
<span>walls</span> or on a <span>tower</span>. One needs three <span>good
horses</span> for drawing it.</div><div data-layout="middle">

The passe-volant weighs vi <span>quintal</span>, is eight or nine
<span><span>pans</span></span> long. Its ball weighs two <span>lb</span>, &amp;, for
its charge, a <span>lb</span> &amp; a half of <m>powder</m>. At the breech
it has three balls &amp; two in the front. Two <span>horses</span> can move
it, for a single <span>horse</span> does not begin to move a piece. It is
used for the defense of <span>houses</span>, or for taking among the
<span>infantry</span> to break a rank of <span>cavalry</span>.</div><div data-layout="middle">

The <span>faulconneau</span> weighs 4 <span>quintals</span>, is x
<span><span>pans</span></span> long. Its ball weighs one <span>lb</span> &amp; a
quarter, its charge is half a <span>lb</span> of <m>powder</m>. At the
breech three balls, at the front, two. To move it, two <span>horses</span>,
although such pieces are hardly moved insofar as they only serve to
defend <span>houses</span>. The ones which are carted around either for
battery or for siege combat, are cannons, culverins, medium-sized
<span>bastardes</span> &amp; field pieces</div><div><i>Continued...</i></div></div></folio></body></html>
