gather the <m>pieces of molds</m>, break them on a <span>long table</span>
with a <span>large billet</span> in order to pulverize<s><span>s</span></s>
them well, <add>and, better yet, <span>sieve</span> it finely</add>. Put
them in some <span>pots</span> into the <span><span>tiler</span>â€™s oven</span> or
<span>bread oven</span>, several times, when it is well lit, in order that
they become very red. Once cooled, repestle them, if need be, <add>and
<span>sieve</span></add>. Next, put it in a sufficient, neat <span>dish</span>,
or <span><span>semal</span></span> or <span>vessel</span>, and wet it with <m>clear
water</m>, and grind it &amp; stir with a <span>thick stick</span>, until it
is well wetted &amp; washed &amp; that the <m>filth</m> goes on the
surface of the <m>water</m> &amp; continue to stir it thus, like the
<m><span>gip mat</span></m> that one prepares to gild with <m>burnished
gold</m>, five or six <span><span>days</span></span>, until it is not at all
lumpy. <s><mark>#</mark> <span>nota</span></s> And, each time that
you stir it again, leave it to rest &amp; empty the <m>clear water</m>
which will be on top, by tilting, or with a <span>bowl</span> or
<span>sponge</span>, and put some <m>clear water</m> back in, &amp; thus
wash &amp; stir it until it is well fine &amp; purged of all
<m>filth</m>. <span>Nota</span>, <mark>#</mark>. Next, leave it a little
to drain <add>and dry</add>, and make from it some little balls wetted
in <m>water of sal ammoniac</m>, and once thus <s>d</s> dried
<s>l</s>, put them to reheat at great heat in a <span>reverberatory
furnace</span>, where they should be be quite red, <span>a good space of
time</span>. Once they are reheated in this way, pulverize them &amp; try
to <span>mold</span> something in a <span>frame</span>, having moistened your
powder with <m>water of sal ammoniac</m>. And reheat &amp; redden the
<span>frame</span>, &amp; if your sand retracts, one needs to pulverize
again &amp; wet it in <m>water of sal ammoniac</m>, reduce into little
balls &amp; reheat it &amp; redden &amp; continue so many times that it
does retract from the <span>frame</span> when you redden it. The main thing
is that it is well reheated for otherwise the <m>sal ammoniac</m> would
not calcine well &amp; render the sand coarse, &amp; for this reason,
one does not need too much <m>sal ammoniac</m> in it.
