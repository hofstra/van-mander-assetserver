And soon it will
be dead, without any lesion which deforms it. For large animals, for
whom one would need a lot of <m>eau-de-vie</m>, one uses
<m>vinegar</m> and <s><span>er</span></s> <m><span>urine</span></m>. But for small
ones, only <m>eau-de-vie</m>, which is done sooner. <br>

When your animal is dead, take it out &amp; clean it carefully of its
old skin, if it sheds, or of the filth, or of the <span>lice</span>, like
<span>lizards</span> have, and then apply thus.</div><div data-layout="left-top">



now put enough in a <span>glass</span>, &amp; soak there &amp; keep there
continually the head of the animal, or the whole of it, if it is not
big.</div><div data-layout="left-top">

of the animal</h2><div data-layout="middle">Having made provision of <m><span>fat earth</span></m> called
<m>clay</m>, that should be grey, because that commonly the best, or
another which has good binding &amp; will should well prepared &amp;
beaten, such that it is handleable without attaching to the
<span><span>hands</span></span> nor the work, make a <span>lazagne</span> or like a
<span>torteau</span> of this <m>earth</m> equally flattened with a <span>round
stick, which <span>pastry-makers</span></span> use, which should be a little
thicker than a <span><span>thumb</span></span>. And on this
<span>tourtelle</span>, arrange your animal, <s><span>aya</span></s>
imitating in that its nature, &amp; <s><span>fa</span></s> the fashion in
which it is commonly shaped. And firstly, with a good <span>needle</span>,
pierce it from underneath, in the middle of the throat, &amp; up to
<s><span>u <span></span></span></s> the top bone of the head. Retract the
<span>needle</span>, &amp; in its place &amp; its hole, put the <span>point of
an <m>iron wire</m></span>, of such a length that it suffices to hold the
head of the animal as <s><span>q</span></s> high as it must be, &amp; if
the skin gets in to the inside <s>&amp;</s> when you put in the
<span>point</span>, pull it out with <s><span>a</span></s>
<s><span>point</span></s> the edge of your <span>small pincers</span>, &amp;
arrange it as it was. Push the other end of the <span>point</span> in the
<span>tourtelle</span> of <m>clay</m>. Thus, the head will be held high,
which will have better grace &amp;once fixed; next, arrange the gesture
of the body, &amp; the feet, &amp; the entanglement as you think will
look best. And so that it is secure &amp; does not move at all when you
throw in the sand, <s><span>mects</span></s> secure the legs
<s><span>&amp; le corp</span></s> with little <span>points of <m>iron
wire</m></span>, having already made the first hole with a very sharp
<span>needle</span>. Do the same on the body parts that you deem necessary,
<s><span>plantant</span></s> making sure that the <span>points</span>
passing through the animal are fixed in the <span>tourtelle</span> of earth,
and not so far in front that they jut out beyond the body of the animal
by a</div><div data-layout="left-top">



Take a <span>fine needle of <m>steel</m></span>, &amp; which is the sharpest
possible, in order that, making with it the first hole to place the <span>points
of <m>iron</m></span>, it passes without forcing anything, &amp; by its
harshness, does not push in or pull out the skin. Next, put in a thickish
<span>point of <m>iron</m></span> in thick places, &amp; thin ones in thin
places. But head as a secret to not plant, in the first go, the
<span>point</span> passed through the animal in the slab of <m>earth</m>,
<s><span>pour</span></s> but having planted it, take it out of the
<m>earth</m> &amp; not out of the animal, &amp; <s><span>fais
ains</span></s> next, fix it. This is done because by fixing it the
first time, it pushes in the skin of the <span>snake</span> and by taking
the point out, it replaces the skin in its original state.</div><div data-layout="left-bottom">



When you put the <span>points</span> again you have already used, clean them
well of <m>rust</m>, so that they do not take away some skin.</div><div data-layout="bottom">



The main layout of your arrangement is to <s><span>di</span></s> place
the head raised &amp; looking sideways. For this effect, pierce the head
on a <span>solid plank or table</span> <s>&amp; <span></span></s>, making the
<span>point</span> pass through the bottom of the throat,
<s><span>sâ€™arrestan</span></s> entering into the top of the head
