batteries, usually weighs fifty-five or lx
<span>quintals</span>. At the breech it carries the <span>thickness of
<s><span>b</span></s> two balls &amp;<s><span>l</span></s> three parts
of one ball <add>the one</add></span>. At the front, it carries
<s><span>ba</span></s> the <span>thickness of one ball &amp;
<s>two</s> three parts the two</span>. It is thirteen or fourteen
<span><span>pans</span></span>long. But they are very troublesome to drive. The
head-on battery, to accomplish its task quickly <s>is</s> &amp;
batter with great force, is at <s><span>d</span></s> one-hundred fifty
<span>paces</span> &amp; at two hundred. <s>And</s> It is true that one
batters well from three or 4 hundred <span>paces</span>, but it is necessary
to give it more <m>powder</m>. Its common load is <s><span>p</span></s>
of xx <span>lb</span> of <m>powder</m>, its ball of 40 <span>lb</span>. One
needs xxv <span>horses</span> to draw it. When one fires it farther than its
usual range, one puts in a <span>half <span>ladle</span></span> of <m>cannon
powder</m> more. A cannon can fire
4^(xx) or a hundred shots <span>per
<span>day</span></span>, but one needs to refresh it every time after one
has fired <s>te</s> nine or ten shots, if the battery is steadily
used. For if there is a break, it is not necessary to refresh it as
often. For two <span>quintals</span> of <m>copper</m>, or two <span>quintals
&amp; a half</span> if it is for large cannons, one puts one
<span>quintal</span> of <m>metal</m> <add><mark>#</mark></add>. The
<m>metal</m> is composed at the beginning of eight <span>lb</span> of
<m>tin</m> for one <span>quintal</span> of <m><span>rosette</span></m>, while
for large bells one only puts six <span>lb</span> of <m>fine tin</m> for one
<span>quintal</span> of <m><span>rosette</span></m>, to give it a <span>bigger
voice</span>. For the more <m>tin</m> there is, the clearer the
<span>sound</span> is. <s>Its</s> For gun founding, if one provides the
material &amp; <m>charcoal</m>, as one usually does, for
<span>masters</span> do not have the means, one gives x to xii
<span><span>lb</span> per quintal</span>. And <s>for the mat</s> when the
<span>master</span> provides everything, one gives him 40 <span><span>lb</span>,
<add>according to the <span><span>King</span></span>'s ordinance</add>, per
quintal</span> for large pieces <s>&amp;</s> such as cannons, and for
small pieces, L <span><span>lb</span></span> . For the more material there is,
the more profit the <span>master</span> has of it. One founds another kind
of cannon-perriers of xxx <span>quintals</span> which are longer than the
others, and easily eight <span><span>pans</span></span> long, &amp; they are for
battering defenses &amp; <span>casemates</span> <s><span>s</span></s>,
placing them via <span>trenches</span> on the <span>edge of the ditch</span>
<span>by night</span>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

On each side of the opening of the breech they give the <span>thickness of
half a ball</span>. And then they also add on each side the <span>third part
of a ball</span>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

The composition of <span>French</span> cannons is of <span>one quintal of
<m>metal</m> for two of <m><span>rosette</span></m></span>.
But those of <span>Toulouse</span> &amp;
<span>Poncet</span> puts iii of <m><span>rosette</span></m> &amp; one of
<m>metal</m>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

The <m><span>rosette</span></m> for re-melting is more profitable than
<span>cauldrons</span>, which turn entirely into <m>filth</m>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



Old pieces are composed of almost <s><span>de dem</span></s> <span>as much
of one as of the other</span>, namely one <span>part</span> of
<m><span>rosette</span></m> &amp; one of <m>metal</m>. One recognises this
composition with a <span>burin</span>. For its substance is found to be sour
