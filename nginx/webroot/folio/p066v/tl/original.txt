To make <m><fr>or mat</fr></m> beautiful, put in a little <m>varnish</m>
or <m>fatty oil</m>, not from that which is made from the cleaning of
<tl><fr>pinceaulx</fr></tl>, but the pure, which is made fatty <env>in
the sun</env> or mixed with <m>ceruse</m>.</ab>

<ab><m><fr>Or mat</fr></m> of this sort is scarcely less beautiful than
<fr><del>es</del></fr> <add><m>burnished gold</m></add>, and lasts
longer <env>in the rain</env>, &amp; besides, &amp; is made sooner.
