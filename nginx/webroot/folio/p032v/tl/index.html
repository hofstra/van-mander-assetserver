<span>partition walls of rooms</span>, which they weave almost as fine as
the <m>straw</m> <corr>hats</corr> worn by <span>villagers</span>. And
they make them in long bands, some the <span>width of ten
<s><span>b</span></s><m>straws</m></span>, others of thirteen. And they
work on them mainly <span><span>in summer</span></span>. And <span><span>in
winter</span></span>, when they put it to use, they sew it. But beforehand,
they put it in <m>dye</m> and commonly make it in three colors, green,
red, and sometimes violet. The green one is made in <m><span>pastel</span>
woad dye</m> only, because green being made from yellow and blue, the
<m><span>pastel</span> woad</m> discharging itself onto the <m>straw</m>,
which shows its dark yellow, one obtains bright green. For the red, they
use <m>alum</m> and <m><span>brazilwood</span></m>. For the violet, they use
<m><span>pastel</span> woad</m> &amp; a little <m>copperas</m>, which
darkens the blue with its black <m>dye</m>.</div></div><div id="p032v_2"><h2><span>Glassworker</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">They have no invention for making a perfect red in a work, so that
one needs to reheat it. However try the <m><span><span>German</span>
red</span></m>, which is <span>rouge d'escaille</span>. They make their common
red with some <m>sanguine</m>, <m>looking-glass tin</m>, <m>rock
pieces</m>, <m>litharge</m> &amp; a bit of <m>scales of iron</m>. The
said red saturates one side &amp; the other of the <m>glass</m> in order
that it has more color, if it saturated only one side it would be very
pale orange.</div></div><div id="p032v_3"><h2><span>Founder</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">They pay xx <span>lb</span> for a <span>quintal</span> of <m>rosette</m>,
which is harder to melt than <m>latten</m> because it is softer. For,
the softer the <m><add>great</add> metals</m>
<add><mark>#</mark></add> are, the <s>soft</s> harder they are
to melt. The <m>tin used to make bells</m>, which is <m>fine tin</m>
<s>is more</s> and which is brittle, is easier to melt than <m>lead,
which is soft</m>. <m>Latten, made brittle by the <m>calamine</m></m> is
melted more quickly than <m>red copper</m>. The <m>metal, which is the
substance of bells</m>, mixed with <m>tin</m>, and very brittle, is soon
melted. The more <m>silver</m> is alloyed, the sooner it melts, that is
why <m>solder</m> is made with it. In <span>Germany</span> they make very
light candlesticks, it is because they turn them by means of
<m>water</m>, but they are breakable. A <span>quintal</span> of
<s><span>per</span></s> <m>fine <span>coppersmith</span>'s rosette</m> is
sold for xxx or 40 <span>lb</span>. Another type used by <span>founders</span>
is sold for xii or xv <span>lb</span>. The <span>quintal</span> of <m>metal</m>,
six <span>lb</span>.<s>Put in</s></div><div data-layout="left-middle">
