<head><m>Sand of burnt <al>oxen</al> bone and rock salt</m></head>

<ab>I pulverised them separately &amp; finely ground them on
<tl><m>porphyry</m></tl>, as much as I could. Then I mixed <ms>as much
of one as the other</ms> &amp; reworked them on
<tl><m>porphyry</m></tl>. Next, I moistened it in <tl><m>paper</m></tl>,
folded in a wet <tl>napkin</tl>, which is made faster than in the
<env><tmp><fr>serain</fr> of the night</tmp></env> or in the
<env>moisture of the cellar</env>. And I have not found anything else
which releases more neatly than this one. It wants to be rather humid.
And if you want to cast very thin, make sure it is very hot. It came out
very neatly in <m>soft tin</m>, like the first one, and withstood
several casts. For <m>tin</m>, I believe that it is not necessary to
seek a better one, nor for <m>fine lead</m> also, which comes out almost
as neatly as <m>tin</m>. <del><fr>Tou</fr></del> the <m>bone of the foot
of <al>oxen</al></m> is always so lean on its own that, without being
mixed with one or two parts of some <m>fat sand</m> &amp;having bond
such as <m>tripoli</m>, <m>salts</m>, <m>felt</m>, <m>ashes</m> &amp;
similar things, it would not release, &amp; would not mold neatly for it
crumbles.</ab>

<ab>Always put the most delicate part, such as the face, above, so that
nothing falls in it that could hinder your fusion.</ab>

<ab>It does not want to be reheated for <m>lead</m> and <m>tin</m>,
<del><fr>m</fr></del> and is better very new &amp; fresh.</ab>
