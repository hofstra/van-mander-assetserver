It happens often that what you have cast makes flashing, either through
fault in the <span>mold</span>, or from the cast, or from the <m>metal</m>.
The fault in the <span>mold</span> comes from <m>plaster</m>, which is not
hard &amp; strong and does not withstand fire (which is corrected by
mixing it with <m><span>crocum</span></m>). Usually as well, if there is an
imperfection, it is from the cast. If there is also too much <m>tin</m>,
in a moderately thick thing, it does not come out well, because
<m>tin</m> cast thickly retracts &amp; becomes porous. Also, things
molded hollow are fanciful to cast. If, therefore, some flaw should
happen, take a <span><m>leather</m> cushionet</span>, full of fine sand,
&amp; having placed it on the <span>bequet</span> of the
<span><span>goldsmithâ€™s</span> table</span>, where one <span>files</span>, place
your work on it &amp; secure it with a <span>rope</span>, <add>which passes
under your <span><span>foot</span></span></add>. The sand in the <span>bag</span>
obeys &amp; arranges itself by and by, thick on one side &amp; thin on
the other. Then, forthwith, with a <span>burin</span>, make &amp; trace
roughly the fine lines, which were omitted or which are not apparent
enough, either with a <span>file</span> or a <span><span>chaple</span></span> remove
the flashing. And if there is some fault in the substance, which left some
pit or something too hollow, rescrape this with a <span>burin</span>, and
notch around the edge, then imprint this with some <m>wax</m>. And place
the imprint on a <span><m>delicate plate of lead</m></span>, &amp; mark
thus the appropriate measure of <m>lead</m> or of the alloy similar to
your substance, then place the piece of the notched thing &amp; attach
it well with some <span><m>latten wire</m></span>, then rub the edge with
<m>rosin</m> if it is <m>tin</m> or <m>lead</m> &amp; place all around
some small thin pieces of <m>solder</m> or <m>tin</m> or other things,
then with a <span>hot <m>iron</m></span> or in the fire of the
<span>forge</span>, <m>solder</m>, and next repair this with the above-said
tools, &amp; with the appropriate <span>small chisels</span>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

For <m>gold</m> &amp; small work, one needs to ciment it on a ball of
<m>lead</m>, which will be placed on the <span>cushionet</span> &amp; will
be held thus with the <span>rope</span>.</div><div id="fig_p152v_1" data-layout="left-middle"><img alt="" classname="inline-figure" src="/bnf-ms-fr-640/figures/p152v_1.png"></div><div id="fig_p152v_2" data-layout="left-middle"><img alt="" classname="inline-figure" src="/bnf-ms-fr-640/figures/p152v_2.png"></div></div></folio></body></html>
