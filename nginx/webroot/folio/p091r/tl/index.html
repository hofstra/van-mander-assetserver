to <s><span>estre</span></s> cut <add>well</add>, because there is a
danger of wounding the marrow, &amp; if it is wounded at the point of
juncture, it takes uneasily, like from the <span>vine</span>, from all
<span>peaches</span> &amp; <span>apricots</span>.</div><div data-layout="middle"><span>Apricot trees</span> have a very thin bark, &amp; thus one needs
to graft them onto young trees which do not yet have thick bark, like on
shoots of <span>prune trees</span> &amp; <span>almond trees</span>.</div><div data-layout="middle">The grafts scarcely <s><span></span></s> take if the cut of the tree is
dampened. One needs then to graft in <span><span>serain</span> &amp; mild
weather, &amp; not too cold &amp; windy</span>.</div><div data-layout="middle">Old wood that one leaves to graft is necessary if one grafts on a
tree that is already made &amp; of good size, because being such, it
tightens the graft more, &amp; if it is from young wood, it is so
compressed that it cannot profit. But old wood resists the compression
of old wood <s>than the young</s> better, because it is harder than
the young. But if the graft is all of old wood, it will never hold
beautifully, but turns fragile &amp; short &amp; slow to
grow.</div></div><div id="p091r_2"><h2>Molding with <span><m><span>cuttlefish</span> bone</m></span></h2><div data-layout="middle">Guard against keeping them <span>in a damp place</span>, for they are
well prone to getting moist. If your medal is small, cut the <m>bone</m>
in two then even it out with a <span>knife</span>. And on a <span>hooked
<m>rooftile</m></span>, well dry &amp;well smooth &amp; covered with
<m>pulverized <span>willow</span> charcoal</m>, rub &amp; smooth the two
half <span><m>bones</m></span>. Thus they imbibe this <m><span>willow</span>
charcoal</m>, which makes them release, &amp; guard against removing
anything. Then on a <span>counter bone</span>, that is to say a lump of
<m>brick</m>, smoothed to the size of your <span><m>bone</m></span>, place
your medal, &amp; then on this one, place the <span><m>bone</m></span>,
&amp; press well with some other piece of the same size above. And for
the second time, mold it, but before, <span>ponce</span> on top with
<m><span>willow</span> charcoal</m> &amp; blow gently, then press as before,
and it will come out neatly. If it is for a spoon handle, one needs two
whole <span><m>bones</m></span>. All cast work is brittle &amp; subject to
breaking, because the <m>metal</m> expands when cast, &amp; retracts
&amp; condenses when <span>hammered</span>. That is why, one ought to
retrace the cast thing with a <span>chisel</span>, &amp; in this way the
<m>metal</m> retracts, and let it thus <span>escrouir</span>. If the piece
for molding is of high relief, first trace the <span>mold</span> &amp; the
cavity with a <span>pen-knife</span>, to make way for the medal &amp; then
mold. And if the medal has two sides</div><div data-layout="left-bottom">Before casting, heat the
<span><m>bones</m></span> in order to make them lose only the coldness &amp;
dampness.</div><div data-layout="left-bottom">When the <m>lead</m> gets too hot, it
calcines.</div><div><i>Continued...</i></div></div></folio></body></html>
