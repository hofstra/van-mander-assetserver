<ab><m>perfume</m>, &amp; similar things. But take heed that it is
necessary that the <m><add>black</add> wax</m>, with which you mold, be
hard, in order that, quickly &amp;<del><fr>du</fr></del> more drily,
it retracts in order to see if it is well imprinted. It is rendered
harder by adding into the already melted one more <m>melted sulfur</m>
&amp; a little <m>rosin</m>.</ab>

<ab>One makes the <tl>relief puncheons</tl> of <m>untempered steel</m>,
then one tempers the<corr>m</corr>, &amp; with <corr>these</corr> one
strikes on <tl>matrices</tl>, not reddened in fire, as some think, but
on <tl><m>steeled iron</m></tl>, reheated &amp; sweetened, which one has afterwards
tempered.</ab>

<head>Cast</head>

<ab>Do not cast at once for in doing so, the <m>metal</m> is
regurgitated <corr><del>&amp;</del></corr> <del>in</del> &amp; the
<m>metal</m> gets cold before it goes down. But, cast bit by bit &amp;
taking your time.</ab>

<head><tl>Molds</tl></head>

<ab>Those of <fr>noyau</fr>, when being reheated, want to be set on
<m>charcoals</m> a <add>little</add> spent, without the air touching
them, like the <tl>frame molds</tl> want to be <del><fr>recu</fr></del>
drie<corr>d</corr> <env>in the open</env>, &amp; uncovered.</ab>

<head>Thick works of <m>tin</m></head>

<ab>They do not want to be cast in <m>lead</m> or <m>red tin</m> like
thin &amp; delicate things. It is enough if it is <del><fr>f</fr></del>
well melted &amp; hot. Thin things want to be quite hot &amp; of <m>red
tin</m>.</ab>

<head>Cleaning closed <tl>molds</tl></head>

<ab>One needs to let them cool rather than blow inside to clean them,
for once hot they retain the <m>ash</m>. Once cold, they are cleaned
better. Take a <tl><m>thin wire of latten</m></tl> or a <tl><m>delicate
straw</m></tl> to clean the tail completely, for this is what makes the
gate. Blow into it &amp; suck, drawing it to you. Before molding,
thicken the tail with <m>wax</m>, then cut it,

&amp; join &amp; <m>solder</m> a tail of <m>latten wire</m> by
<m>solder</m>. The lumps of a flower, it is a little thing, for this can
be removed with the <tl><fr>chaple</fr></tl>, but so that leaves come
out well, then the <m>paint</m> covers everything.</ab>
