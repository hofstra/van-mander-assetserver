<span>noyau</span> &amp; keep it from shifting. All of this being

<span>table</span>, the hole at the top, as it is here marked on the side,
&amp; then adapt a <span>circle of <m>soft clay</m></span>
<s><span>aultr</span></s>, two <span><span>fingers</span></span> high, around
the hole, like for other <span>molds</span>. And then wet your molding sand,
moderately thick, &amp; cast it through the hole until it is well
filled, up to the surface of the <span><m>clay</m> circle</span>. But take
heed to not cast <s><span>r</span></s> in through the middle of the
hole, but rather from the side, for, because the already made
<span>mold</span>, drinks and sucks the moisture <s>of the new</s>. The
new one that you cast in <s>which dries quickly</s>, on the edge of
the <span>mold</span>, being quickly dry, <s><span>s</span></s> would
obstruct the <span>mold</span> &amp; it would not finish filling. And when
you cast from the side, if you recognize that it is obstructed, you can
clear a path. Having cast in, blow on the <s><span>f</span></s>
<corr><s>the</s></corr> wet gate, &amp; put, a few times, the
<span><span>end of your finger</span></span> in the hole, <s><span>po</span></s>
or some <span>small point</span>, to unblock it, &amp; make the hollow
<m>wax</m> fill up. Cast in, at the end, the sand wetted a little
thickly to give strength to the <span>mold</span>, for <m>water</m> coming
to the surface <s><span>s</span></s> <add>of the <span>mold</span></add>,
always makes it softer. Having set, scrape off the <span><m>clay</m>
circle</span> &amp; the excess which is on the hole, through which you
cast the <span>noyau</span> &amp; nothing will be discernable. When your
<span>mold</span> is thus prepared, <m>lute</m> it all around with the
same sand which served for the <span>molds</span>. Next, reheat it in a slow
fire, at the beginning, &amp; the mouth of the gate at the bottom, in
order that the <m>wax</m> flows out <corr>gently</corr>. For if you were
to give it great heat until the <m>wax</m> came out, it would boil
inside &amp; leave some pustules &amp; lumpy things, although</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



This <span>point</span> is placed in the middle &amp; through the hole of
the gate, when the <span>mold</span> is in several pieces, like a
<span>turtle</span>, and this is done in order that the <span>noyau</span> does
not shake. But when the mold is only of two pieces, it is not necessary
to put <span>points</span> in the middle of it.

Before casting the <span>noyau</span>, make some notches all around the hole
through which you want to cast, in order to always better secure the
<span>mold</span>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

Mixed <m>tallow</m> is the reason that, when emptying the <m>wax</m>,
the hole does not become obstructed. One needs <span>half</span>
<m>tallow</m> &amp; <span>half</span> <m>black wax</m>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

All very thick pieces come out better in hollow, because a thick mass of
mostly <m>lead</m> remains hot a long time &amp; eats the
<span>mold</span>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

You can, after the cast is done, mold <s>a</s> the part of the shell
of the belly where you have made the hole on the natural
one, and reattach it with
<m>solder</m>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

<mark>X</mark>Note that, after your <span>noyau</span> is cast, it is
better to put the <span>mold</span> in <m>hot water</m> to open it, in order
to remove the most <m>wax</m> that you can, always softening
<s><span>a</span></s> it in <m>hot water</m>. For the less <m>wax</m>
that remains in it, the better, in order that, when reboiling a lot in
the <span>mold</span> when you reheat it, no pustules or lumps are made in
it. And then, if there is hardly any <m>wax</m>, you will not need to
reheat it as much. When opening the <span>mold</span>, the cast will break.
But it can easily be repaired, even though you
