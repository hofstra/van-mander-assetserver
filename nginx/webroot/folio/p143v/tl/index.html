come to join one with the other by means of the said gates,
which you will start in the round parts, empty of <m>wax</m>, that you
have put at the end of the feet to attract the <m>metal</m>. Thus, the
gate being made by <m>wax</m>, you are in no danger of encrusting
something from the molded animal. And it is more expedient to make
thus the gate of <m>wax</m>, to cast the second mold on top, than to
wait to do them after the <span>mold</span> is
reheated<s><span>q</span></s>, for at that point, it is necessary, if
possible, that everything be ready. One needs to heat well &amp; even
redden the <span>molds</span>, where they are gates of <m>wax</m>, in order
that it melts well &amp; leaves nothing inside.</div></div><div id="p143v_1"><h2>Carcanets made <span>Ã  jour</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">They are molded like <span>crayfish</span> in <span>noyau</span>, first with
one side being raised up with <m>clay</m> which is hollow, &amp; then
one uncovers them from the other side &amp; one makes the second
casting. They can also be cast well in <span>frames</span>, provided
that they are released easily. If they are not, one models them in
<m>wax</m>, or else one fills the cavities that were not able to release
with <m>wax</m> or <m>clay</m>.</div></div><div id="p143v_2"><h2><m>Iron filings</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">Because usually <m>filings</m> are mixed with <m>nastiness</m>, it
is good to redden them in fire to burn the <m>impurities</m>, and then
wash them in <m>clear water</m>. In this way, the dirt will go to the
top of the <m>water</m>, that you throw out, &amp; the <m>good
filings</m> will go to the bottom.</div></div><div id="p143v_3"><h2><span>Carnations</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">Because the ones that are cast are usually massive, <s>or
