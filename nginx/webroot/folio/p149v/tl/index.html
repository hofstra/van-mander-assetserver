<m>wooden</m> forms they please turned on a <span>lathe</span>. And then,
with some <m>wax</m>, they model on top masks, festoons, and whatever
they please. And next they mold in three, in four, or several
pieces.</div></div><div id="p149v_2"><h2><m>Gold</m> <m>solder</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">They take, on a <span><m>gold</m> <span>denier</span></span>, a
<span><span>grain</span></span> of the <m>fine <span>alo√©</span></m>, like <span>old
<span>douzains</span></span> are.</div></div><div id="p149v_3"><h2>Molding a <span>fly</span></h2><div data-layout="middle"><span>Large flies</span> can be molded &amp; <s><span>g</span></s> made
by casting. But one needs <s><span>par d</span></s> to anoint underneath
their wings with <m><span>wheat</span> oil</m>, which dries quickly and
fortifies them &amp; gives them a little thickness. The same is done to
<span>butterflies</span>, <span>cicadas</span>, <span>grasshoppers</span>, &amp;
similar things. But to cast them more easily, one applies them on some
leaf or bouquet. The others are <span>made by hand</span> with a <m>very
thin silver sheet</m>. <add>One ought not to keep them once dead,
because they dry out and their legs break.</add></div><div data-layout="left-middle">

<m><span>Wheat</span> oil</m> is put underneath delicate things to render
them more rigid &amp; firm &amp; to make them hold their natural
position. Because being weak &amp; delicate, the wet sand, weighing down
their tops, would change their form.</div></div><div id="p149v_4"><h2><span>Bat</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">They have very thin wings, &amp; if they are large &amp; dry and
their wings extended, one would need a very large <span>mold</span> &amp; it
would not be certain that the <m>metal</m> would run sufficiently. Thus,
when you want to mold them, choose the medium-sized ones &amp; make the
pose <s>qu</s> so that they have their wings half folded. Because in
this way they will come out better, but support the side of the wings
with <m>wax</m>, as you know, to feed the cast well.</div></div></folio></body></html>
