<span><span>pans</span></span> <s>&amp; will reheat well the</s>. But first,
it is necessary that you have reheated your <span>furnace</span>
<s>with</s> with a little of the <span>big charcoal</span>, such that
the bottom is red hot and then you will put there the load of
<span>charcoal</span> in the middle of which you will put your <m>iron</m>,
not all at once but ten or fifteen <span>lb</span> each time. And when this
will be swallowed <s>&amp;</s> at the bottom of the<span>furnace</span>,
always put in as much again. And add three or four <span>shovels</span> of
<span>new charcoal</span> which should be of the biggest kind and moistened,
in order that it may have more heat &amp; and not be consumed too soon.
And when you see that your <span>furnace</span> is full of substance, around
two <span>quintals</span>, or less if you don't have that much, you will
leave the <span>charcoal</span> to be consumed by itself. And when the
<span>charcoal</span> is as it were reduced down to the level of the
<span>furnace</span>, you will be able to pour into <span>molds</span> &amp;
<span><m>iron</m> or <m>metal</m> shells</span>, which is even better
because one <m>iron</m> attaches to the other. And it is necessary that
the inside of the <span>mold</span> be well covered with <m>wetted
ashes</m>, in order that it does not adhere to it.</div></div><div id="p016v_1"><h2>Against Go<exp>norrhea</exp></h2><div data-layout="middle">Soak <m><span>quince</span> seeds</m> in <m>clear water</m> &amp; of

pass it tightly across the places with the hair &amp; they will attach

other <m>silks</m> because its color does not charge as do blue &amp;
green, which also cost cheaper for the <span>worker</span>. Black is less
abundant because it charges much.</div></div><div id="p016v_4"><h2>Keeping <m><span>oranges</span></m></h2><div data-layout="middle">One needs to choose them quite whole, without being rotten, &amp;
put them &amp; fill a <span>well closed <s>and</s><m>tin</m>

long-lasting, so say some. I believe, however, that it is enough to keep
them in a <span>cool &amp; dry place</span>, in such manner that they are
not crowded. It is better if inside the wick there is a <m><span>hemp</span>
thread</m>, which gives it more light &amp; makes the wick hold up
straighter. Otherwise, if it is all of <m>cotton</m>, as those of
<span>Montauban</span> make, it is necessary to snuff it out often, for
after it has burnt <s><span>il</span></s> a little, the <m>cotton</m>
droops &amp; makes the <span>candle</span> drip.</div></div></folio></body></html>
