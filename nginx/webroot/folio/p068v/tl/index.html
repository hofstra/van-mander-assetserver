<span><span>fingers</span></span> and to easily pestle it in a <span><m>metal</m>
mortar</span>, or better yet, in an <span><m>iron</m> one</span>. Next, it
will be easy to grind it, not <s>only</s> on <m>common
<span>marble</span></m> <add>that would corrode</add>, but on
<span><m>porphyry</m></span>, and it is necessary that it be finely ground
with <add><m>water</m></add> so that when putting it on your
<span><span>fingernail</span></span>, you find it soft without any asperity like
the colors that the <span>painters</span> grind for <m>oil</m>. You can
use <s><span>au lii</span></s> this one, once dry, in a <span>frame</span> instead
of sand, without moistening it with anything nor reheating it. If you do
not like it, fumigate the cavity with <m>sulfur</m> smoke or <s><span>de
p</span></s> with the tip of the flame of a <span><m>wax candle</m></span>
that barely makes smoke, and it will make a very neat &amp; shiny &amp;
polished work, in <m><add>pure</add> lead</m> &amp; <m>tin</m>. I would
say the same for <m>finely pulverized tripoly</m> that does not want to
be <s>not</s> reheated or moistened. <m>Burnt linen</m> gives less
trouble than others, because it does not need to be reheated, nor
moistened, &amp; molds <add>and releases</add> very neatly <s>&amp;

previous ones &amp; withstands several castings. First you ought to burn
it with a flame, then leave it to rest &amp; to be consumed with its
fire until it is completely dead, then finely grind it on
<span><m>marble</m></span> or on a <span><m>paper</m></span>. <s>But because a

the fire, to render all of it fine &amp; impalpable, I believe it will
be even better. But because a lot of <m>linen</m> is reduced to very
little when burned, if you want to save some, you can sprinkle only the
medal that you want to mold &amp; cover it, and fill the <span>frame</span> with <m><span>pestled</span> slate</m>, which molds also very neatly, but
note that the first cast is always the most beautiful &amp; the neatest.
If you cast at your convenience <m>soft tin</m> that seems to be
burnished in little wheels that <span>pewterers</span> sell, comes out
very neatly &amp; approaching the color of <m>silver</m>, without mixing
in anything else, it is true that one ought to cast it rather hot, &amp;
so that the molded object should be four <span><span>fingers</span></span> away
from the cast. In order to know its heat, first melt it well, <add>so
hot</add> <s>with such a <span>degree of heat</span></s> that it
promptly burns a <span><m>paper</m></span> or <span><m>straw</m></span> placed
inside, by simmering. Then remove it from the fire &amp; leave it to
rest a little &amp; cast the <m>tin</m> mixed
