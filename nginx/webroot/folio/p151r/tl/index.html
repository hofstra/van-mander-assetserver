sulphured wax</m>, has such little substance, since being dry and
purified, that it leaves nothing inside, and flows very gently. As for
the <m>charcoal</m> which is mixed in, if some remains, it burns &amp;
reduces to <m>ash</m> &amp; is emptied afterwards, by blowing through
the gate. You could even open your <span>mold</span> after the <m>wax</m>
has melted, if there is no fanciful thing which could break, like some
reattached thing or similar. After having covered the <span>clamps</span>
with the <m>lute</m> from your sand &amp; having covered all of the
<span>mold</span>, give it on top a layer of <m>common lute</m>, &amp; then
sprinkle this with some <m><span>pestled</span> brick</m>, in order that you can
handle it better. Let the <m>lute</m> dry slowly, before firing it,
which melts the <m>wax</m>. The <m>wax</m> having left through the gate,
that which remains with the <m>charcoal</m> will burn. Being reheated
for the first time, <m>lute</m> it <s><span>pou</span></s> once more,
<s>to reheat it the second time</s> because the <m>plaster</m>, not
being good, will have readily made the <span>mold</span> retract, and the
joints will crack open, which might make large flashing. And for the second
time, one ought not to reheat it, if you only want to cast in
<m>lead</m> or <m>tin</m>, but rather only make sure that the
<m>lute</m> is quite dry &amp; the <span>mold</span> moderately hot. For
these <span>turtles</span> that have a large size &amp; enough thickness, it
is better to <s>mold <span>ault</span></s> cast <s>your
<m>lead</m></s> an alloy <span>half</span> of <m>lead</m> &amp;
<span>half</span> of <m>tin</m>, especially for hollow things. For, if you
only have very thin &amp; very weak things to cast, like flowers, rely
rather on the abundance of <m>lead</m> than of <m>tin</m>, which becomes
porous, once cast a little thick, &amp; readily makes some flaw around
the cast. <span>Master Alexandre</span> says that he has never gone wrong
with <span>half</span> <m>tin</m> &amp; <span>half</span> <m>lead</m> for things
weighty &amp; with the <span>thickness of the <span>back of a
knife</span></span>. If there is <m><span>crocum</span></m>, the joints hardly
appear &amp; consequently the flashing is very small &amp; thin. You can
repair &amp; through the hole of the belly, pull the <m>earth</m> of the
<span>noyau</span>, leaving it wet a long time,</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

When you have cast your <m>black wax</m> in the <s><span>a</span></s>
<span>mold</span>, &amp; when it is well cold, you need to <s>the</s>
open your <span>mold</span> halfway, to make the cast. And if the
figure of <m>black wax</m> breaks, there is no danger, for it
can always be reattached with a <span>hot <m>iron</m> <s>touching</s>
point</span>. Or else, if the pieces are not separated from the
<span>mold</span>, <s><span>qu</span></s> they meet up &amp; join like
beforehand, by joining &amp; binding well the two halves of the
<span>mold</span>. When the representation is large, one needs to cross
inside many <span><m>iron wires</m></span>, to sustain the <span>noyau</span>.

<mark>A</mark>only in <m>lead</m> or
<m>tin</m>. However, one needs to redden the <span>mold</span> nearly as
much as if there were inside some animal to burn, in order that the
<m>wax</m> melts well &amp; leaves nothing inside &amp; flows on its
own, by keeping the <span>mold</span> leaning towards the gate when
reheating it. And when the <span>mold</span> is reheated, leave it to cool
gently, then blow inside, and draw towards yourself, while sucking, in
order that the <m>ashes of the wax</m> come out. Do this with a
<span>bellows</span>.</div><div><i>Continued...</i></div></div></folio></body></html>
