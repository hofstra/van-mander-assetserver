tend towards blue, and others towards green, choose those which tend
towards yellow to make beautiful shadows in <m>oil</m>, for shadow,
especially that of men, is yellowish. And for this effect use very
strongly ground <m>jet</m>, which you will mix with a little
<m><add>yellow</add> ochre</m> &amp; <m>lead white</m>. Or else, after
you have ground your <m>lead white</m> <s><span>bro</span></s> and
<s>clean <span>p</span></s> gathered it with the <figure>

</figure>, grind the <m>jet</m> into it. Thus it will be more
desiccative, &amp; making on its own a yellowish black. A little white
mixed in renders it perfect for men's shadows. Blacks which make a
greenish black are appropriate for women's shadows. Take, then, some
black of <span></span>, a little <m>sap-green</m> &amp; <m>bistre</m>, &amp;
you will have a perfect shadow for women in <m>distemper</m>.</div><div data-layout="left-top">



The powder of <m><span><span>orber√©</span>grain</span></m> is darker than
<m>umber</m> &amp; when you lack <m>umber</m>, the said powder will do,
but it does not have body.</div></div><div id="p065r_2"><h2>Flesh color</h2><div data-layout="middle">You must know well the mixing of colors &amp; the appropriate
shadows, but above all make sure to soften them well. And note &amp;
observe that a thing which appears flat needs to be softened lengthwise,
as if going from <s><span>l<exp>ett</exp>re a ga</span></s> right to
left like

</figure>

, and whatever ought to appear round must be softened in circles.</div></div><div id="p065r_3"><h2><span>Mirror</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">When you make flesh colors, it is good to have a
<span><m><span>cristallin</span></m> <tl>mirror</tl></span>, which represents
well after nature, and in which <s>it</s> you will see if your
shadows are soft enough or too crude. But do not look at it with a
<span>candle</span>, for <span>firelight</span> will make the shadows reddish.
The <span>painter</span> also teacher himself with the <span>mirror</span>,
for he sees in it what the natural can do.</div></div><div id="p065r_4"><h2>Greasy colors</h2><div data-layout="middle">If some part remains shiny and does not seem dry after the layered
colors have penetrated, it means that this part is greasy, &amp; that
the second colors one layers on would not take on the dry layer, unless
you rub this part with <m>soap</m> or breathe on it, because the
humidity will make the colors take.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



One cannot layer <m>oil</m> on cut <m>paper</m> &amp; model as in
<m>distemper</m> because the colour would run. Thus, to <m>gild</m> with
<m><span>or mat</span></m>, one needs to pounce &amp; then layer the <m>gold
color</m> with the <span><span>pinceau</span></span>.</div><div data-layout="left-bottom">



All greasy colors, such as <m>ceruse</m> and <m>minium</m>,
<m>massicot</m>, <m>ochre</m>, <m>lead white</m> are good for making
gold color.</div><div data-layout="left-bottom">



Any color or thing that thickens when <m>water</m> is put with it when
it is being ground has body. But those that lack it, such as
<m><span>pestled</span>glass</m>, <m>lake</m> &amp; become clear.</div></div></folio></body></html>
