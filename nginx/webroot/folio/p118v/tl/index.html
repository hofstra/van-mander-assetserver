composed, as is said, of <m>plaster</m>, <m>brick</m> &amp; <m><span>alum
de plume</span></m> , is excellent for casting in <span>frames</span>, and I
have experienced it thus: I <span>pestled</span> the pieces which had come out of
<span>molds <span>en noyau</span></span> in a <span>mortar</span>, dragging the
<span>pestle</span>, because this sand is very <span>doulx</span>. I did not
pass it through the <span>sieve</span>, because the <m><span>alum de
plume</span></m> mixed throughout, which binds it, would not pass; but I
ground finely upon <span><m>marble</m></span> what seemed to me too coarse.
And having prepared it thus, I moistened it with <m>sal ammoniac
water</m>, made of <m>sal ammoniac</m>, <span>as much as two
<span>walnuts</span></span>, in a <span>bottle of <m>common water</m></span>, the
same size as a <span>bottle in which one boils <m>tisane</m></span>, or in a
<span>good pot of <m>water</m></span> so that you find <s><span>d</span></s>
the <m>water moderately salty</m>. I mixed throughout <s><m>water</m>
of</s> <span>half a <m>glass</m> </span> of <m>sal ammoniac</m>, <s>two
othe</s> two <s><span>au t</span></s> <span><span><m>silver</m>
spoonfuls</span></span> of <m><span>eau-de-vie</span></m>.
<s><span>J’a</span></s> Having thus moistened the sand in such a fashion
that it took hold well, nevertheless coming apart easily, I sprinkled my
medal with <m>pulverized charcoal</m> with a <span>file</span>, to rid it of
<m>oil</m>, and all other <m>grease</m>, that are necessary to avoid,
for they <s>make</s> would hinder a good release. I blew on my medal
&amp; molded it, <add>and the female part of the <span>frame</span> once
filled</add>, I marked &amp; made a line on the reverse <s>of
the</s> &amp; edge of the medal, &amp; on the nearby sand as well. In
order that the second <span>frame</span> <s><span>s’em</span></s> take the
imprint thereupon to denote the place for making the cast, <s>once
filled</s> <s>the female part of the <span>frame</span> once filled</s> I
uncovered the outline of the medal and pounced the whole side with
<m>pulverized charcoal</m>, and then filled the male part with sand.
<s>Once made</s> I separated the <span>frame</span> and did not hit the
corners of the <s><span>d</span></s> medal to make it release, because
that knocks the sand &amp; makes it <s><span>esp</span></s> crumble.
Rather I struck the back of the <span>frame</span>, retaining the obverse of
the medal on the bottom, and it molded very neatly. If it had not
released thus, I would have waited to remove it until the
<span>frames</span> had been dried out over fire. I lit <s>the</s> a row
of charcoals between two little <span>trivets of <m>iron</m></span> in the
form that you see, and put the back <s>the</s> &amp; reverse of the
<span>frames</span> thereupon, &amp; the imprint on top, because in this
way, they dry out gently. And if, by chance, they should crack from
being too moistened, it is on the back,which <s><span>pr</span></s>
takes the harshest fire, &amp; the imprint remains safe &amp;
<corr>whole</corr>.</div><div data-layout="left-top">
For the best, one needs to reheat the sand used in the <span>noyau</span>
before using it in the <span>frames</span>, until it no longer
contracts.</div><div data-layout="left-bottom">

For medals &amp; flat things, the true heat of <m>lead</m> &amp;
<m>tin</m> is when it is melted gently.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

Note that I filled the <span>frame</span> before pressing it, and did not
hit it at all, but rather pressed it only with the strength of my
<span><span>hands</span></span>, because hitting it makes it go awry. Secure
your <span>frame</span> that it does not shift at all, &amp; if you put some
moistened sand under it, it will only hold in place more firmly.</div><div data-layout="left-bottom">

Make the gate so that it is not too thick, so as not to overcharge the
medal, but wide enough near the medal that it embraces a third part. Do
not forget the vents.</div><div data-layout="left-bottom">

To dry <span>frames</span> is to rid them of humidity, so that they no
longer smoke, once nevertheless having been very hot.</div><div data-layout="left-bottom">

<span><span>Recuire</span></span> is to redden the <span>frame</span>, which is done for
<m>gold</m> and for <m>silver</m>.</div><div><i>Continued...</i></div></div></folio></body></html>
