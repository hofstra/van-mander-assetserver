simmer, put in <m>powdered sandarac gum</m> so that it soon melts. And
over a <m>charcoal</m> fire stir continuously until the <m>sandarac</m>
is well melted, which you will know by taking a little of the said
<m>varnish</m> on a <span>plate</span>. And if it is fatty when you handle
it with a <span><span>finger</span></span>, it is ready. And for one <span>lb</span>
of <m>lavender spike oil</m>, you will put five <span>ounces</span> of
<m>pulverized sandarac</m>, although some only put in four
<span>ounces</span>, but this is not so good nor so fatty. This one is
promptly dry. <span>Framemakers</span>, to avoid the trouble of polishing
their <m>ebony</m>, varnish it with this, as do <span>guitarmakers</span>.
This is not as appropriate for panels as that of <m>fine turpentine</m>,
though it is good for the moldings of panels. One did not used to
varnish the landscape of a panel when <m>linseed varnish</m> was in use,
because it would have yellowed the landscape. But with that of
<m>turpentine</m>, one varnishes everything. You can put in
<m>pulverized mastic</m> extracted in tears or otherwise, and it will be
more dessicative in place of <m>sandarac</m>.</div><div data-layout="middle">If you want to varnish on <m>plaster</m> or a wall, first put on
your very hot <m><span>colle de retaille</span></m>, because if cold it
would not penetrate the wall, &amp; when you would put your
<m>varnish</m> on, it would come off.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



<m>Varnish of spike lavender oil</m> is not as appropriate for colors as
that of <m>turpentine</m>, for <m>spike lavender oil</m> <s>makes them
die</s> <add>eats away at</add> the colors since it is too
penetrating.</div></div><div id="p004r_2"><h2>For removing <m>varnish</m> from an old panel that has yellowed &amp;
varnish it anew</h2><div data-layout="middle">Take <m>white soap</m> &amp; <m><span>sieved</span> ashes</m>, &amp;
soak both in <m>water</m>. And with a <span>sponge</span>, take the said
<m>ashes</m> &amp; <m>soap</m> &amp; rub the panel with them. And as you
see that the old <m>varnish</m> is removed, throw a
<span><span>bucket</span></span> of <m>water</m> against the panel to clean it.
Next put it for <span><span>a quarter of an hour</span></span> <span>in the
sun</span> to make it dry and to revive the colors. Next, once the panel
dries, you can apply your <m>turpentine varnish</m>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



Make sure the colors do not come off.</div></div></folio></body></html>
