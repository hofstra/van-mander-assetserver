before, &amp; in the <m>plaster</m> cast in <m>wax</m>, from which will
come out a relief that you will repair very neatly, and
<s><span>b</span></s>model it as you fancy. And then, you will model
this relief of <m>wax</m> again in <m>plaster</m>, or better yet, with
your wet sand <mark>#</mark> like for <span>noyau</span>, &amp; in the
latter cast in some <m>lead</m>, &amp; from this you will have a very
neat relief, &amp; if it is not, repair <add>on the <m>ciment</m> or
otherwise</add>, &amp; take heed that it is always of good release. And
this one will always serve you well for making as many hollows as you
please, in this way. Place <add>half of</add> your figure of
<m>lead</m>, <m>oiled</m> &amp; wetted with <m>eau-de-vie</m> according
to the above, in the <span><m>clay</m> slab</span>, then mold this half with
some <m>white plaster</m>. Having set <s>next</s> <add>and having
well smoothed &amp; flattened the <m>plaster</m></add>, take your
<m>black wax mixed with sulfur</m>, as is said, because it leaves
nothing in the <span>mold</span> &amp; melts quicker. Wet it in <m><span>warm
urine</span></m>, &amp; once softened enough, make it into an imprint
on the half of the <m>lead</m> figure, and <s>it</s> you will have a
very neat hollow. Shape next the <m>wax</m> hollow in a square shape, as
you please, with sufficient thickness &amp; smooth it well on all sides,
&amp; <s>thus</s> next, mold this hollowed <m>wax</m>, both
imprinted on one part &amp; flat &amp; smooth on the other, in the same
fashion that you mold flat medals of <m>wax</m> or <s>other</s>
<m>metal</m> in <span>noyau</span>. And the <span>mold</span> in <span>noyau</span>
will render in <m>silver</m> or such <m>metal</m> as pleases you
<s>the <span>m</span></s> a similar figure to the <m>wax</m>, that is to
say flat &amp; smooth on one side &amp; hollow on the other. And having
cleaned &amp; put this hollow to be whitened, if it is <m>silver</m>,
you will be able to mix there some works of <m>sugar</m>,</div><div data-layout="left-middle"><mark>#</mark>
