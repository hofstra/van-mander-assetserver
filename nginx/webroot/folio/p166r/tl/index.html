If something is omitted: the <span>harvester</span> is not reproached for
leaving some ears of <span>wheat</span>. If any <span>artisans</span> complain
that one discovers their craft secrets, and if the
<corr>goddesses</corr> of <span>Eleusis</span>
complain, as they did to <span>N</span>. the
<span>Pythagorean</span>, that one has divulged their mysteries, excuse
yourself based on the words of the ancient <span>Hebrews</span> quoted by
<span>Josephus</span>.</div><div data-layout="middle">

As the <span>hen</span> carefully searches the garbage thrown out of a
<span>house</span> for a crumb or a grain that she divides among her
<span>chicks</span>, thus one distributes to <span>orphans</span> that which
has been researched among the arts considered vile &amp; abject.</div><div data-layout="middle">

Tablet of <span>Cebes</span>, idle, but the
<span>workshop</span> represents all things
active. </div><div data-layout="middle">

If the jealous disapprove that these things are picked up &amp; taken
from others, reply that since <span>Nullum est jam dictum quod non dictum
aut factum sit prius</span> &amp; that one
knows that all arts were invented <span>in the space of a thousand
years</span>, so that you do not think that you are able to invent
anything new but rather rediscover anew the books of <span>Numa</span>,
buried <s>par</s> &amp; long unknown &amp; forgotten, in order to
publish them for those who do not know them; so that as the
<span>preceding day</span> is teacher for the <span>subsequent day</span>,
thus you needed to learn from those who proceeded you in order to teach
to those who come after. The <span>Latins</span> took from the
<span>Greeks</span>, as <span>Cicero</span> from <span>Plato</span> &amp;
<span>Virgil</span> from <span>Homer</span>. <span>Aulus
Gellius</span>, <span>Valerius Maximus</span> only
made a collection from various <span>authors</span> who had already
written. <span>Livy</span> made his xxiii book from the 2nd or 3rd of
<span>Polybius</span>. <span>Serapis</span> was deemed the <span>inventor</span>
of agriculture among the <span>Egyptians</span> , &amp; however so was
<span>Ceres</span> among the <span>Sicilians</span>. <span>Pythagoras</span> &amp;
others from <span>Tyana</span> learned by their travels the disciplines
which they claimed to have invented in their country, &amp;c. Will one
not say the <span>weaver</span> has made a cloth or precious stuff, even
though he did not dye &amp; twist, wind &amp; prepare the bobbins and
balls of thread? Will one say the <span>mason</span> has not made a
<span>house</span>, but only piled up ready-made stones?
