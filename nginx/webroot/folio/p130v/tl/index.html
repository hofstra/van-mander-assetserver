to proceed differently than with other animals, because its shell is
very difficult to <s>mold</s> burn &amp; in this case, one
<s><span>le</span></s> needs to sometimes reheat the <span>mold</span> three
or four times. And with all of this, it leaves a hard crust, grey like
<m>ash</m>. But because it does not mold in one piece &amp; one cast,
like plants, but rather in two casts like <span>snakes</span> that release
well, one removes this crust, <add>not with <m>quicksilver</m>, which
<man>would do nothing</man></add>, after it
has been opened, with the very fine point of a <span>pen-knife</span> with
dexterity, as with the little crusts of the second cast, which enter in
the nooks that the sand or the molded animal made. But,
<s><span>la</span></s> because it has curved legs, here is the cunning
way &amp; secret for releasing it. Therefore, as you have molded it on
one side, which is on the back, in the same fashion as others, uncover its
belly, &amp; all its curved legs. Make your second cast in the same fashion
as others, but, as it will have set, keep from opening the <span>mold</span>
until you have first reheated it well. Otherwise, because of its curved
legs, you would break everything. In this lies the dexterity. If you
recognize, after having reheated &amp; opened it, that the crust is not
burned enough, reheat until it does.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

no need to soak it, for once reheated, it will open by itself.</div></div><div id="p130v_2"><h2><span>Stag beetle</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">It is as difficult to burn as a <span>crab</span>, therefore do for it

that the <span>mold</span> does not corrupt. Next, make a small lasagna of
<m>paste</m> of such thickness that you would like, and having anointed
with <m>butter</m> <s>your</s> the hollow of your first hollow
<span>mold</span>, adapt the <m>paste</m> to it and then make your second
<span>mold</span> on top. If you were to anoint with <m>oil</m>, it would be
