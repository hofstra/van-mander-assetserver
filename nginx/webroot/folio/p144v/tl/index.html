<span>brushes</span>, place <s>the</s> the <span>circle of
<m>clay</m></span> around the <span>slab</span>. Then, with a <span>band of
<m>clay</m></span> placed on the middle of <s><span>e</span></s> the
<s>the</s> back of the <span>turtle</span>, as you see, &amp; at the
widest place, divide your <span>mold</span>. Subsequently, <m>oil</m> with
your <m><span>pinceau</span></m>, dedicated for this, the half of the shell
you want to mold. Wet in <m>hot water</m>, <span>so that without burning
yourself, you can hold your <span><span>finger</span></span> in it without
burning yourself</span>, your sand, a little <s><span>p</span></s> thick.
And <s><span>f</span></s> before throwing it, rub the shell with
<m>eau-de-vie</m>. And next, cast your sand &amp; let it set and note
that all things that have shells, or that are hard, or are not
malleable, like <span>snakes</span> &amp; <span>lizards</span>, want to be
<m>oiled</m> to release. Things that are malleable do not need this.
<m>Hot water</m> makes the wet sand <s>in <m>water</m></s> set
better on <m>oil</m>, which otherwise would be refused. Your half of the
<span>turtle</span>, having thus <s><span>desp</span></s> been molded,
separate it with its <span>half mold</span>, from the <span><m>clay</m>
slab</span>, that you will set aside to return it to when it is necessary.
Next, clean your <span>half mold</span> &amp; smooth it &amp; flatten, like
the others. But because it happens that because <s><span>u</span></s> of
the <m>clay</m> <span>entredeux</span>, the <span>half mold</span> will consist
of more than half of the <span>turtle</span>, cut &amp; pair down smoothly
the excess, &amp; clean everything well with <span>brushes</span>. Then,
make on the top edge of the <span>mold</span>, on the side that is cut &amp;
halfway, two notches, like for other <span>molds</span> and return your
<span>turtle</span> to its <span>slab</span>, as it was &amp; secure its two
legs, which are not molded, with <span><m>iron wire</m> points</span>. And
stuff all around what is empty, up until the edge of the top shell with
<m>clay</m>. Next, place the <span>circle</span> around and put a
<m>clay</m> <span>entredeulx</span> on the first <span>mold</span>, a little
above the notches. And having <m>oiled</m> the <s><span>d</span></s>
first <span>half mold</span> &amp; its notches and the shell of the
<span>turtle</span>, &amp; having also showered it with <m>eau-de-vie</m>,
heat your <m>water</m>, wet you sand with a little <m>water of sal
ammoniac</m> &amp; the said <m>hot water</m>, &amp; cast. Having set,
adapt the sides of these two <span>molds</span> smoothly &amp; on each side
secure their joint, which only recognize each other a little, with two
<span>clamps</span>, in order that when uncovering afterwards the underneath
of the <span>turtle</span>, they are not undone. Next, uncover the side of
the belly &amp; of the throat, in the way that you uncover a
<span>crayfish</span>, which is the most difficult to mold of the little
beasts, which are molded in two halves.</div><div id="fig_p144v_1" data-layout="left-middle"><img alt="" classname="inline-figure" src="/bnf-ms-fr-640/figures/p144v_1.png"></div><div id="fig_p144v_2" data-layout="left-middle"><img alt="" classname="inline-figure" src="/bnf-ms-fr-640/figures/p144v_2.png"></div><div data-layout="left-middle">



You can mold the <span>turtle</span> with one piece for each side, but one
would need to burn it. And afterwards, to make the hollow, the reheated
<span>mold</span> cannot be <m>oiled</m> because it drinks the
<m>oil</m>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

If there is some <m><span>crocum</span></m> in the sand, the joints of the
<span>molds</span> will almost not recognize each other. </div><div data-layout="middle">
