<head>Molding <al>turtles</al></head>

<ab>The <al><env>water</env> turtle</al> is more beautiful to mold
because it has prettier scales &amp; straight legs. And <al>those of the
    <pl><env><fr>garrigue</fr></env></pl></al> have crooked ones. They are long
living, getting ready to kill them, open their mouth &amp; pass a long
<tl>penknife</tl> through all the intestines, &amp; then make it swallow
some <m>vinegar</m> mixed with <m>eau-de-vie</m> or <m><bp>urine</bp></m>, as for
<al>snakes</al>. One needs to mold them in several pieces, &amp; the
back itself sometimes, because the sides for some are more narrow than
elsewhere &amp; are not released on this occasion. To make them die, one
ought not boil them, for they come apart &amp; even the shell, from the
<m>hot water</m>. They come out better hollow, because their great
thickness corrupts the <tl>mold</tl>. <add><al>Those from
<env>water</env></al> are more vigorous. <al>Those from
<env><fr>garrigue</fr></env></al> are thinner, slower, &amp; more
sleepy. If you scratch <al>those of the <env>water</env></al> on their
shells, however sleepy they are, they move. <al>Those from 
<pl><env><fr>garrigue</fr></env></pl></al> do not.</add></ab>

<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>They die rather quickly in
<m>vinegar</m> mixed with a little <m>eau-de-vie</m> or <m><bp>urine</bp></m>, as
with all other animals.</ab>

<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>They keep themselves, in the
<tmp>winter</tmp>, with their eyes closed &amp; are as dead, being
numbed by the <env>cold</env>. They hide <env>in the earth</env> or
<env>under <m><pa>wheat chaff</pa></m> or <m>warm manure</m></env>, &amp; live
only on the moisture of the earth.</ab>

@One ought not to mold them as soon they die because they are still too
stiff. But on <tmp>the next day</tmp>, you will manipulate them &amp;
fold their legs as you wish.</ab>

<head><pro>Molders</pro> from <pl>Foix</pl></head>

<ab>Those who mold crosswise<comment>c_090r_02</comment> make their sand with
<m><la>crocum</la></m> &amp; <m>calcined slate</m>, but <m>slate</m>
always retains its asperity &amp; becomes porous, because it is a fat.
In the <fr>noyau</fr>, it is not good, in sand, it can be accomodated.
They <tl>sieve</tl> their sand, grind it on <tl><m>porphyry</m></tl>,
and wet it in <m>water</m>, &amp; they take away the finest, which is on
top, then reheat it.</ab>

<ab>Once molded, it can be removed without burning it, because it
releases well. Choose the biggest &amp; the lumpiest. Because they
contain a lot of <m>metal</m>, it is best to mold them hollow, for they
come out better. You could make your cast in one piece &amp; large, but
it <del><fr>s</fr></del> would be awkward to cut. It is best to do it in
three or 4 parts, which are a little wide close to the animal, &amp;
include the most of the edge of this, which is close to the gate, that
can be done. Make also some gate conduits from the end of </ab>

Let the <tl>mold</tl> cool before opening it, especially for thick
