because it has prettier scales &amp; straight legs. And <span>those of the
    <span><span><span>garrigue</span></span></span></span> have crooked ones. They are long
living, getting ready to kill them, open their mouth &amp; pass a long
<span>penknife</span> through all the intestines, &amp; then make it swallow
some <m>vinegar</m> mixed with <m>eau-de-vie</m> or <m><span>urine</span></m>, as for
<span>snakes</span>. One needs to mold them in several pieces, &amp; the
back itself sometimes, because the sides for some are more narrow than
elsewhere &amp; are not released on this occasion. To make them die, one
ought not boil them, for they come apart &amp; even the shell, from the
<m>hot water</m>. They come out better hollow, because their great
thickness corrupts the <span>mold</span>. <add><span>Those from
<span>water</span></span> are more vigorous. <span>Those from
<span><span>garrigue</span></span></span> are thinner, slower, &amp; more
sleepy. If you scratch <span>those of the <span>water</span></span> on their
shells, however sleepy they are, they move. <span>Those from 
<span><span><span>garrigue</span></span></span></span> do not.</add></div><div data-layout="left-middle">They die rather quickly in
<m>vinegar</m> mixed with a little <m>eau-de-vie</m> or <m><span>urine</span></m>, as
with all other animals.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">They keep themselves, in the
<span>winter</span>, with their eyes closed &amp; are as dead, being
numbed by the <span>cold</span>. They hide <span>in the earth</span> or
<span>under <m><span>wheat chaff</span></m> or <m>warm manure</m></span>, &amp; live
only on the moisture of the earth.</div><div data-layout="left-middle" data-layout-hint="tall">

@One ought not to mold them as soon they die because they are still too
stiff. But on <span>the next day</span>, you will manipulate them &amp;
fold their legs as you wish.</div></div><div id="p143r_2"><h2><span>Molders</span> from <span>Foix</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">Those who mold crosswise make their sand with
<m><span>crocum</span></m> &amp; <m>calcined slate</m>, but <m>slate</m>
always retains its asperity &amp; becomes porous, because it is a fat.
In the <span>noyau</span>, it is not good, in sand, it can be accomodated.
They <span>sieve</span> their sand, grind it on <span><m>porphyry</m></span>,
and wet it in <m>water</m>, &amp; they take away the finest, which is on
top, then reheat it.</div></div><div id="p143r_3"><h2><span>Toad</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">Once molded, it can be removed without burning it, because it
releases well. Choose the biggest &amp; the lumpiest. Because they
contain a lot of <m>metal</m>, it is best to mold them hollow, for they
come out better. You could make your cast in one piece &amp; large, but
it <s><span>s</span></s> would be awkward to cut. It is best to do it in
three or 4 parts, which are a little wide close to the animal, &amp;
include the most of the edge of this, which is close to the gate, that
can be done. Make also some gate conduits from the end of </div><div data-layout="left-middle">
