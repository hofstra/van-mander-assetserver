<add>When it is often melted, it becomes brittle &amp;
<s><span>fl</span></s> frangible, because it is cast very hot &amp;
renders it half calcined. Therefore, use new ones. </add></div><div data-layout="middle">The alloy that I have put in use for <span>lizards</span> &amp;
<span>snakes</span> is two <span>℥</span> of <m>fine tin</m> for one <span>lb</span>
of <m>new &amp; unadulterated lead</m>. The <span>mold</span> is made of the
above said sand, common to all <m>metals</m>, when it is reheated let it
cool <span>until you can hold your <span><span>finger</span></span> without harm
in the hole of the gate</span>. As for <m>lead</m>, one melts it in a
<span>crucible</span> <s><span>ju</span></s> in the fire, with
<span>bellows</span>, until the <span>crucible</span> &amp; the <m>lead</m> are
red. When it is in this state, purge it of <m>charcoal</m>, either
with a <span>scraper</span> made for this purpose or with the wind of a
<span>little bellows</span>. <s><span>l</span></s> This done, let it rest
thus red &amp; reheat a little on its own, then throw in, if you want,
a little <m>resin</m>, to burn the <m>filth</m>. However some find it
better not to put any in, because it leaves <m>filth</m>. But, when they
are ready to cast, they ought not to forget to throw inside as well,
<span>as much as a <span>bean</span></span> of <m>looking-glass tin</m> for each
<span>lb</span> of <m>lead</m>, and that it <s><span>e</span></s> should be
red like <m>melted metal</m> when it enters in the <span>mold</span>. And if
the <span>mold</span> is big, it is better to put it in a <span>press</span>, in
order that it joins well &amp; that the <m>lead</m> does not spread at
all outside the <span>mold</span>. However, should this happen &amp; that
for the first or second or third time your <span>mold</span> were not full,
cast boldly, for, provided that your <m>metal</m> is red, it will set
again &amp; join with the other, and come out very neat, like the
principal one. The same can be said for <m>fine tin</m> for thin things.
And the alloy of <m>fine tin</m> is one <span>℥</span> of <m>new lead</m>
for one <span>lb</span> of this. Large <span>molds</span> should be placed in
<span>very tight presses</span>, between two <span><m>sheets of
copper</m></span> <s><span>pu</span></s> &amp; then bury them in the sand,
which is better than <m>ash</m>, because
<s><span>i</span></s><s><span>l</span> is</s> by its weight it seals
better. <corr>Otherwise</corr> these<span> large molds</span> are subject to
opening slightly by the weight of the <m>metal</m>. Some make <span>square
pots</span></div><div data-layout="left-middle">

When the medal is thick, one is not bound to casting as hot as when it
is thin.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

Note that if you want to cast with <span><m><span>cuttlefish</span>
bone</m></span>, they ought not be very hot, because they will burn the
<span><m><span>cuttlefish</span> bone</m></span>. <span>Test for this effect with
<span><m>paper</m></span>. If it reddens the <span><m>paper</m></span>, it is
enough, it is good to cast, but if it blackens the
<span><m>paper</m></span>, it is too hot.</span></div><div data-layout="left-middle">

@If you want to cast a <m>written paper</m>, make your alloy with
<s><span>plom</span></s> <span>half</span> <m>lead</m> &amp; <span>half</span>
<m>tin</m> &amp; as soon as it is melted, cast between two
<span><m><span>carton<add>s</add></span></m></span>, <span>in a very flat &amp;
level place</span> &amp; with a <span>point of <m>gold</m> or <m>hard
wood</m></span>, engrave on the left the writing that you want. And having
poured <m>lead</m> on a <span><m><span>carton</span></m></span>, press on top
with the other <span>adapted <m><span>carton</span></m></span>.</div><div><i>Continued...</i></div></div></folio></body></html>
