malleable once soft &amp; obeys, and thus separates itself from the
piece without leaving anything. But take heed that the <m>melted wax</m>
be neither too hot nor too cold. Some mold with <m>wax</m> heated in
<m>hot water</m>, but in pressing the <span>mold</span>, it becomes gauche
&amp; becomes fake. Once your cavity in <m>wax</m>, you can cast in some
<m>very soft clay</m> &amp; very moistened &amp; clear, &amp; let it dry
