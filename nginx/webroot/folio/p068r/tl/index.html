<span>fishes</span> painted after nature &amp; with colors on <m>simple
<span>carton</span></m> &amp; if you please, on <m>silvered &amp;
<span>burnished</span> paper</m> which will represent the scales. And next,
cover this with <m>very clear lantern horn</m>. You can apply the same
to other works.</div></div><div id="p068r_2"><h2>Planting trees</h2><div data-layout="middle"> One needs to plant them in a <s><span>dry place</span></s>
<span>dry weather</span>, &amp; <m>plenty of earth</m> gathered at the
foot all around, like a mound, in order that the <span>rains</span> do not fill
the holes &amp; drown the trees.</div></div><div id="p068r_3"><h2>Casting</h2><div data-layout="middle">I have tried four kinds of sand for <m>lead</m> &amp; <m>tin</m>:
<m>chalk</m>, <m><span>pestled</span> glass</m>, <m>tripoli</m> &amp; <m>burnt
linen</m>, all four excellent. But as for the <m>chalk</m>, it needs to
be of the softest kind you can find, like <m>the <span>Champagne</span> one
that <span>painters</span> use</m>. It releases very neatly, does not need
to be moistened with <m>magistra</m> or anything else, but needs to be
completely dry, in its natural state, finely
pulverized. The first cast is always the
neatest; however, it will well withstand two or three. But there is only
the first one that you need to take heed of, when you want to remake
your <span>frame mold</span> to take new <m>powdered chalk</m> that has not
yet been put to use, for the one previously used in the <span>frame</span> has
dried out &amp; has no stickiness &amp; bond like the fresh one.
<m><span>Pestled</span> glass</m> can be made from <m>common glass sand, however
cristallin</m> is more excellent, for <m>common glass</m> contains
<s><m>glass</m></s> <m>salt of saltwort</m> only, but
<m>cristallin</m> contains both <m>salt of tartar</m> &amp;
<m>saltwort</m> all together, which both help fusion, the <m>glass</m>
once calcined &amp; reduced to as if to its prime substance. In order to
calcine it perfectly, throw your <m>glass</m>, lumps of whichever sort,
among the largest possible lit <m>charcoals</m> that you can, if you are
lacking some other <s>t</s><add>d</add>e foeu<s>t</s> violent
heat source. And when it will be well red, throw it into
<m>water</m>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">
