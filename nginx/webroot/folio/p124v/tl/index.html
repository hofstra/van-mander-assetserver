from one <s>edge</s> <add>side</add> of the tail to the other, as
you see depicted. But take heed to make sure, that with the <span>end of
the hot <m>iron wire</m></span>, the end of the <m>wax</m> barely touches
the animal, for the sand of the second cast will not touch this part.
But make sure that the end of the <m>wax</m> arranges itself only at the
edge of the empty part of the first <span>mold</span>. Make also conduits of
<m>wax</m> around the legs &amp; around the contours of the body, which
are a little long &amp; they will serve as feeders for the
molded thing.<span></span></div><div data-layout="right-bottom">
