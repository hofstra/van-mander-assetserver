wax</m>, animals are secured on the <span><m>earthen</m> slab</span>.
<add>Wash them first in <m>clear water</m>, once killed in the mixture of
<m>vinegar</m> &amp; <m><span>urine</span></m>, &amp; with a <span>sponge</span>
purge their mouth, eyes and head of the <m>slaver</m> which comes out,
for the sand would never set well there and would become
lumpy.</add></div><div data-layout="left-middle">

If you want to make them keep their mouths open, put in a little bit of
<span><span>spinet</span> string</span>, which will not take up space.

</div></div><div id="p165v_2"><h2>Keeping animals</h2><div data-layout="middle">Having molded them once, if you want to keep them for molding again,
put them back into the mixture of <m><span>urine</span></m>, <m>vinegar</m>
&amp; <m>eau-de-vie</m> where you killed the others, and they will keep
for a long time without decaying. If you have a <md>cut on your hand,
take care that this mixture does not touch it</md>.</div></div><div id="p165v_3"><h2><span>Molds</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">Once molded, do not keep them for a long time, but rather use them
<s><span>u</span></s> as soon as you can, because when kept a long time,
they are subject to corrupting.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



When they are reheated, the thing comes out better.

</div></div><div id="p165v_4"><h2><m>Lute</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">When reheating, you can use <m>common lute</m>. But when you want to
cast, strip it from the <span>mold</span> &amp; promptly, with a
<span>brush</span>, layer the <m>lute of plaster that has been used for
<span>molds</span></m>, for it will be dry when it is placed, &amp; cast.
One needs to mainly put this <m>lute</m> on the joints.</div></div><div id="p165v_5"><h2><m>Silver</m></h2><div data-layout="middle"><span>When it quivers</span>, once melted, it is a sign that it is well
hot &amp; because usually it is <m>leady</m>, it is good to throw in it
some <m>lime mortar</m>, for this attracts &amp; gathers the
<m>lead</m>.</div></div><div id="p165v_6"><h2><span>Fly</span> wings</h2><div data-layout="middle">In order that they come out better, put from the gate to the edges
of these some <m>veins of wax</m>. Make sure also that under the belly
there is enough <m>wax</m>, for this is what makes the gate.</div><div id="fig_p165v_1" data-layout="left-middle"><img alt="" classname="inline-figure" src="/bnf-ms-fr-640/figures/p165v_1.png"></div></div><div id="p165v_7"><h2>Joining some <span>fly</span> wings, or similar</h2><div data-layout="middle">They are joined with <m><span>fish</span> glue</m> mixed with
<m>eau-de-vie</m> over slow fire, heating also the work. Then this is
covered with <m>modelling wax</m>, which is grey.</div></div></folio></body></html>
