you have made the first cast &amp; it has set, give a little thickness
to the reverse of your <m>paper</m> with <m>melted butter</m>, which is
the most appropriate means there is, &amp; for fortifying the wings of
either a <span>butterfly</span> or a <span>grasshopper</span>, or some delicate
part of an animal to which you need to give thickness. But take heed to
apply this <m>melted butter</m> underneath the wing or in whichever
place it cannot be seen. For giving thickness to a <span>pansy</span> or
other flowers, <m>butter</m> is not good, but rather <m><span>wheat</span>
oil</m>, which is soon dry &amp; holds firm. <m>Wax</m> would not be
appropriate here for it is too hot once melted, &amp; it makes the thing
to which it is applied contract. But <m>butter</m> is amiable and
handleable.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">If you write on <m>paper</m> or on
<m>common <span>carton</span></m> &amp; that your
<m>letter</m> is with <m>gum</m>, the humidity of the <span><m>clay</m>
slab</span> or the wet sand for <span>noyau</span> will moisten your
<m>letter</m> <corr>&amp;</corr> undo it. Therefore write with
<m>cinnabar</m> wettened with <m>oil</m>, on <m>oiled paper</m>
&amp;impress.</div><div data-layout="left-middle"><mark>+</mark>Reheat your
<span>molds</span> with <m>charcoals</m>,firstly lit in the <span>forge</span>,
in order that the fire is not so hot &amp; does not break the
<span>molds</span>. And do not make as much fire where the <span>mold</span> is
thin, like in the place where it is thick.</div></div><div id="p142v_2"><h2><span>Molds</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">Make some notches, with these, that enter more in the inside of the
<span>mold</span> than on the outside, for in this way, they have more
strength. Keep from reheating in one go &amp; in a too ardent fire, for
this makes them <s>melt</s> break.</div><div data-layout="right-middle">Do not keep them in a <span>humid or
enclosed place</span> if they are not well dry, for they go moldy. So do
dried animals.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">@One ought not to reheat <span>molds</span>
twice when the animal can be removed without burning, like a
<span>toad</span>, which can well be molded hollow like all thick animals.
However, it is always good to redden the <span>mold</span> once.</div></div><div id="p142v_3"><h2><m>Lute</m> for <m>luting</m> your <span>molds</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">I have not found one that is made more quickly than this one, nor
better. Take this <m>lean earth of which the <span>founders of artillery
&amp; bells</span> make their <span><span>trusseaulx</span></span> and
<span>molds</span></m>, which is lean &amp; sandy. Wet it
<s><span>e</span></s> moderately like a very thick <m>mortar</m>. Mix in
it about <span>half</span> <m><span>horse</span> dung</m> &amp; then have it
beaten well. Next, mix in a <span>third part</span> of <m>discarded cloth
waste</m> or <m>cloth shavings</m>, and beat it again quite strongly.
You can reheat your <span>mold</span> as soon as the <m>lute</m> is
placed.</div></div></folio></body></html>
