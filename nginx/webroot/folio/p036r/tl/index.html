so that it cannot be seen, &amp; you will very subtly with conceit cast all

cunning</h2><div id="fig_p036r_1" data-layout="left-middle"><img alt="" classname="inline-figure" src="/bnf-ms-fr-640/figures/p036r_1.png"></div><div data-layout="middle">Make a <span>small sheath of <m>plain leather, such as <span>cow</span> or
morocco</m></span>, somewhat thick, <span>as tall as three
<span>fingers</span></span>, sewn like the finger of a glove &amp; <span>large
enough that two <span>fingertips</span> can fit inside</span> &amp; which, at
the tip, which is a little puckered, has a round hole <span>as large as a
double <span>liard</span></span>. Take <s>one</s> two similar
<span><m><span>boxwood</span></m> balls</span>, &amp; let one be hollow &amp;
open with a round hole on one side only so that the <span>thimble</span> can
fit inside. Thus, when you want to perform, you will place your
<span><m>leather</m> sheath</span> on the <span>table</span> with the
<span>ball</span> that is not hollow. Pass a <span>stick</span> inside the
<span><m>leather</m> sheath</span> to show that there is nothing there, also
show the full <span>ball</span>, and hold the one which is hollow &amp; has
the <span>thimble</span> inside it by your <span><span>little &amp; ring
fingers</span></span>, and do this with your <span><span>right hand</span></span>
with which you are holding the <span>stick</span>. Next, you take your
<span><m>leather</m> sheath</span> &amp; place it over the hollow
<span>ball</span> which is in your <span>fingers</span>, &amp; making it seem as
if you are putting some <m><span>oribus</span> powder</m> over it, you put
back the <span><m>leather</m> mold</span> that
contains the <span>ball</span> with the <span>thimble</span> on the
<span>table</span>, then you take the full &amp; solid <span>ball</span>
remaining on the <span>table</span>, and command it to enter from under the
<span>table</span> into the <span><m>leather</m> sheath</span>. Then, when lifting
the <m>leather</m>, the <span>ball</span> seems to be the same,
although it is the hollow one. Then cover it again &amp; command it to
become invisible. And then, lifting the <span>sheath</span> while pressing
it, you will remove it &amp; the <span>ball</span> along with it; &amp;
<s><span>l</span></s>putting it aside with the <span>sheath</span>,
<s>&amp; a <span></span></s> in its place will be found a <span>thimble</span>
for the ladies whose bottom hurts, that is to say, the bottom of the
needle.</div></div></folio></body></html>
