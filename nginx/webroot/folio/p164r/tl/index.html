When you make the gate of some delicate animal, like a <span>snake</span>,
make it come from the side of the belly &amp; under the tail, for from
the side, there are only straight lines, which are a lot easier to
repair than the back, which is more visible &amp; more marked.</div></div><div id="p164r_2"><h2>Repairing flashing</h2><div data-layout="middle">

Having gently removed them with the <span>point of a <span>chaple</span> or
burin</span>, scrape them with the <span>side of the burin</span>, or gently
with a <span>small file</span>, &amp; rub with <m><span>willow</span>
charcoal</m> &amp; <span>little brushes</span>. Make continuous the lines
disturbed by the flashing.</div></div><div id="p164r_3"><h2><m>Leady silver</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">

It degrades a lot, because the <m>lead</m>, which is mixed in, works it
like in the <span>cupel</span>, and makes it jump in little balls at the
edges of the <span>crucible</span>, &amp; on the <m>charcoal</m> which
covers it. It is also fat, and thus it is good to melt all <m>coined
silver</m>, like <span>reals</span> &amp; others, &amp; to put it in ingots
before melting it for casting <span>lizards</span> &amp; animals, for it
comes out better. I molded with it neatly thus, first of all, a
<span>little viper</span> of <m>silver</m>, and made the alloy out of 4
<span><span><m>reals</m></span></span>, of 20 <span><span><m><span>sols</span> from
<span>Spain</span></m></span></span>, &amp; a coin of xx
<span><span><m><span>sols</span> from <span>France</span></m></span></span>.</div></div><div id="p164r_4"><h2>Blowing</h2><div data-layout="middle">

When you melt <m>silver</m> &amp; <m>gold</m>, do not blow strongly
&amp; with violence, because with the <m>charcoal</m>
<corr>consolidating</corr>, the <span>crucible</span> would lower &amp;
<s>the silv</s> could fall over. But when your <span>mold</span> is
ready, at that moment blow strongly to heat well the <m>silver</m> or
<m>gold</m>. Both, once melted, want to be blown from above with a
<span>little bellows</span>, especially <m>gold</m>, for this removes their
<m>smoke</m> &amp; softens them. </div></div></folio></body></html>
