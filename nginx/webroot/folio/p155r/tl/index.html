which are <s><span>aupart</span></s> around the flower are sometimes
very spread out &amp; would make too large a <span>mold</span>, one makes
<add>and molds</add> them separately, and the <span>rose</span> &amp; some
buds separately. And then one joins them with <m>solder</m>, the little
branches &amp; leaves of the <span>rose bush</span> to the stem of the
<span>rose</span>, on which one intentionally leaves the little tips of the
small branches. Put your leaf or <span>rose</span> as low as you can in the
<span>mold</span> because the <m>sand</m> always raises it up. You
<s><span>en</span></s> can also mold several petals together, once
arranged one on top of the other, separating them with <span>threads</span>,
as is said. And regarding the <span>rose</span>, you can give a thin layer
of <m>melted butter</m> on the back of the petal, <s>of</s> <add>on
the first petals on the outside, not those on the inside</add>
<s><span>be</span></s>, to fortify it &amp; give it the strength to
withstand, <add>in order that the wet sand does not spread out &amp;
expand more than it should.</add> You <s>them</s> can also mold well
the leaves of <span>rose bushes</span>, <span>strawberry plants</span>, &amp;
similar things, that are flat &amp; can be flattened without spoiling
them, with two gates; to open your <span>mold</span> when it is reheated
&amp;clean the <m>ashes</m> from it, <s>All</s>, and make vents
&amp; several gates. And this is the easiest way, but the other can also
be done. And with a <m>wax</m> sprue applied &amp; joined from petal to
petal, you can make casts. You can even make a <m>wax</m> sprue from
<add>the back of</add> the first petal <s>until</s>, which will join
to the gate. All of this facilitates the cast. <s><span>Aulcu</span></s>
The principal thing is to let your reheated <span>molds</span> cool down
well, rather than cleaning them &amp; blowing inside them to make the
<m>wax</m> come out, because when the <span>mold</span> is hot, the ash
holds to it as if attached. But when it is cold, it wanders and leaves
with air or when one blows one's <span>breath</span> through the small
opening. </div><div id="fig_p155r_1" data-layout="left-middle"><img alt="" classname="inline-figure" src="/bnf-ms-fr-640/figures/p155r_1.png"></div><div data-layout="left-middle">

You can give quite a little thickness at the ends of the stalks that
support the leaves, anointing them lightly underneath with <m>melted
butter</m>, because the leaves are large &amp; weighty, and the stalk of
<m>lead</m> &amp; <m>tin</m> would not have enough strength.</div><div data-layout="left-bottom">

I would be of the opinion to mold the <span>rose </span>on its own with a
little of its stem close to its bud, &amp; then to join it to a longer
one of <m>tinned latten</m>, because the bloomed <span>rose</span> has great
volume &amp; weight.</div><div data-layout="bottom">

Wet the <span>rose</span> with <m>eau-de-vie</m> before putting it in the
<span>circle of <m>clay</m></span>. Do not forget to <m>oil</m> the gate
with <m>wax</m>. And when you will have cast your wet sand, blow
thoroughly, until it begins to take hold. The <span>rose</span> came out
well. But because the sand is found mixed among the petals, make your
work soak in <m>water</m> for a long time in order that shaking it in
the <m>water</m>, the <m>earth</m> is gone from it.</div></div></folio></body></html>
