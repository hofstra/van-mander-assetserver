fine things, like <span>wormwood</span> &amp; others, one needs to break
them, but before one needs to dip them well into <m>water</m> in which
the twice reheated things dissolve easily. Otherwise, you would not be
able <s><span>f</span></s> to release your work without danger of
spoiling it.</div><div data-layout="middle"><m><span>Good <span>alum de
plume</span></span></m> is white and as lustrous
<add>as</add> <m>white <s><span>c</span></s> silk</m>. It is in pieces
long as a <span><span>finger</span></span>, &amp; is very breakable &amp; wooly
as <m>down</m>. The one made of <m>stone</m> is harder &amp; not so
good. <s><span>Il</span></s> The best of the above mentioned quality is
brought in <span>France</span> near <span>Rouan</span>. The <m><span>alum de
plume</span></m> for our sand is pestled in a <span>mortar</span>, and is
ground further on the <span><m>marble</m></span>, especially since one
cannot think of passing it finely through the <span>sieve</span>, for it is
so fat &amp; wooly, that it would not pass through it. It is this, with
its small soft <s><span>qui</span></s> &amp; thin filaments, which gives
binding to the sand, in a much more excellent fashion than
<m><span>tondure</span></m> in the <m>founderâ€™s earth of the <span>founders
of great works</span></m>, because this <m><span>tondure</span></m> &amp;
<m>cloth waste</m> burns and <m><span>alum de plume</span></m> resists the
fire.</div><div data-layout="middle">To enclose the <span>molds</span>, when you <s><span>em</span></s> throw
onto the things to mold your liquid sand, make <s>your</s> a circle

If you know that your <m>plaster</m> is not strong enough to withstand
the fire without cracking, do not be so scrupulous an observer of the
mixture put here that sometimes you <s><span>mecties</span></s> would
not diminish the quantity of <m><span>alum de plume</span></m>
<s><span>l</span></s><add>d</add> a little bit, for it softens the
<span>molds</span> with its sweetness. Once reheated do not pulverise it, on
this occasion, as fine as said, but leave it as the
<span>apothecaries</span> have ground it, for it does not hinder the
neatness of the cast &amp; gives more binding. When the <s>sand</s>
mold, <s><span>estant</span></s> having set, retains the color
<m>brick</m>, and is reddish, it is firmer.</div></div></folio></body></html>
