<span>kitchen</span> or table</span>, you will make them support a large
weight on their tips laid down &amp; arranged in a triangle, edge to
edge, as you can see, &amp; they would not touch the ground. And if,
after arranging them this way, you turn them the other way without
unjoining them, the tips of the handles can also support a large weight
without touching the ground. You can just as well adapt this to another
use with <span>pikes, with joists</span>, or to promptly make a tripod in a
camp with three <span>halberd points</span>. If the edge of the
<span>knife</span> marked A faces from right to left, the butts of the
handles will rise, but if the edge of the same <span>knife</span> faces from
left to right, the tips will rise.</div></div><div id="p035r_3"><h2>For boiling an <m>egg</m> in <m>cold water</m> without fire</h2><div data-layout="middle">Empty an <m>egg</m> from both ends so that nothing remains inside,
