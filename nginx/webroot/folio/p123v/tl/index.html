morning</span></span>, your <span>crucible</span> in a <span><span>four à
vent</span></span>, &amp; at the beginning, give slow fire, as much for
reheating your <span>crucible</span> than for gently letting the fury of the
<m>saltpeter</m> pass. Then, invigorate little by little &amp; with
judgment the fire. And <s>y</s> leave in the fire’s full vigor, your
substances, for 12 <span><span>hours</span></span>, or a <span><span>natural
day</span></span>. Make each time a good quantity of this substance, to
not repeat it often, because the <md>fumes, which are dangerous, could
hurt you</md>. And before working at it, take in the
<span><span>morning</span></span> <m>good buttered toast</m>, and hold the
said <m>butter</m>, or <m><span>zedoary</span></m>, or <m>gold coins</m>, in
your <span>mouth</span>, and <s><span>ada</span></s> cover your
<span>face</span> with a <span>cloth</span> from the <span>eyes</span> down. From
this mass, the crust will serve you <s>make run</s> <add>to
clear</add> <s>the great works of</s> the <m>silver</m> <add>from
the <m>metallic</m> mass</add> <s>like <span>snakes</span> &amp; similar
things</s> <add>when it starts to melt.</add> <s>But</s> <add>And
then</add>, the grain that will be at the bottom of the
<span>crucible</span> should be put aside for <s>principally delicate
flowers and herbs</s> <add>putting a little in the <m>melted
silver</m> when you want to cast it</add>, <s>However is it necessary
to always put a little of this grain in the <m>silver</m> when <del>you
want to cast</del> it is well melted and when you are ready to
cast</s>. Thus, do as you make fine <m>tin</m> on <m>copper</m>,
&amp; for <m>looking-glass tin</m> on <m>lead</m> and on <m>tin</m>.
And, just as <m>looking-glass tin</m> sours <m>lead</m> and <m>tin</m>
too much, if you put it in too great a quantity, likewise, the grain
composed of the above-mentioned substances would sour your <m>silver</m>
if <s>l</s> you were to put in too much, <add>and obscure it</add>.
This above-mentioned composition will suffice you for a long time, when
it has been <span><span>for a whole day</span></span> on a <s>gentle</s>
gentle fire at the beginning &amp; invigorated degree by degree until
the end. Then, having given it one load of charcoal, let it consume it
by itself, &amp; let your <span>crucible</span> cool. Next, break it. You
will find two hard slabs &amp; <span>tourtelles</span> in the
<span>crucible</span>. The upper one is like petrified <s>Once</s>,
composed of <m>salts sublimated</m> &amp; mixed together. The lower one
is <m>metallic</m>, composed of <m>fillings</m>, <m><span>aes
ustum</span></m> &amp; <m>antimony</m>, having the grain very small.
Pulverize the upper <span>tourtelle</span>, made from <m>salts</m>, &amp;
put some to clear &amp; clean the <m>silver</m>, and the <m>metallic
grain</m> can be used to put in the <m>melted metal</m>.</div><div data-layout="left-top">

Or else, after you have had your drugs pestled by a <span>peasant</span>. And
having put them in your <span>crucible</span>, &amp; the latter <m>luted</m> &amp;

One sells well to <span>silversmiths</span> this <m>metallic</m> mass to
soften their <m>solder</m>, because when melting, <m>latten</m> exhales.
