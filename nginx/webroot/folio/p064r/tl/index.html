after having made your design carefully, keep the space of shadows for
these alone, &amp; also individually that of lights &amp; highlights,
without layering one color all across &amp; then highlighting or shading
on it. And in this way, you further your work, economize your colours
&amp; work neatly. Which is the reason that, the colors not being
muddled nor mixed together, they do not die &amp; you soften the colors
better, since they are not so thick.</div></div><div id="p064r_2"><h2><m>Fatty oil</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">It is not good for working with colors because it makes them thick,
&amp; as difficult to work as <m>azur dâ€™esmail</m>. Therefore use the
<m>clearest <span>walnut</span> oil</m> that you can, &amp; the
freshest.</div></div><div id="p064r_3"><h2><m>Vermilion</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">One ought not to keep it in <m>water</m> when <s>soaked</s>
<add>ground</add> with <m>oil</m> for it loses its color. It is better
to choose whitish <m>vermilion</m> than dark &amp; blackish. For
<m>vermilion</m> is usually mixed with a little <m>lake</m>, without
which it would hardly be different from <m>minium</m>. But the pale kind
one casts more vivacity than the dark one. It is not desiccative, &amp;
for this reason one mixes in <m>calcined <span>cristallin</span></m>.</div></div><div id="p064r_4"><h2><m>Oil</m> colors in <m>water</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">Usually, after grinding them one puts <corr>a</corr>
<s><span>fo</span></s> piece of <m>tin leaf</m> on top, &amp; one puts
them in <m>water</m> to prevent them from drying out. But this is more
appropriate for <m>ceruse</m>, <m>lead white</m>, <m>minium</m> &amp;
<m>massicot</m> than for the others, for <m>lake</m> dies there &amp;
loses its color, as does <m>azure vermilion</m>.</div></div><div id="p064r_5"><h2>Double layer</h2><div data-layout="middle"><m>Ver<add>digris</add></m> does not die, &amp; thus does not need
to be layered twice. But <m>lake</m> &amp; others, &amp; especially
flesh color, <s>the</s> require two layers. Colors hardly change
when they are dry.</div></div><div id="p064r_6"><h2><m>Yellow ochre</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">

One needs a little of it in every flesh color.</div></div><div id="p064r_7"><h2>Softening</h2><div data-layout="middle">

One softens in the same way on <m>oiled paper</m> as on <m>wood</m>. But
it is easier to soften on <m>canvas</m>, because the softening must be
rougher on it.</div></div><div id="p064r_8"><h2>Eye</h2><div data-layout="middle">

Every eye must follow the circle of the <span>compass</span> &amp; not be
flat &amp; square.</div></div></folio></body></html>
