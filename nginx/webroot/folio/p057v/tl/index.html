<span>lambs</span> and young <span>goats</span></m>, almost like
<m>parchment</m> and keep them constantly re-moistened in <span>humid
places</span>. When they want to print some history, they layer them in
the hollows of their figure, then put over the top <m>fine fatty
earth</m> with which cloths are degreased, having pressed &amp; beaten
it well &amp; rendered it moderately humid and soft. Then they put on
the <m>earth</m> a <span>small even board</span> and put the whole in a
<span>press</span> and let it dry <corr>there</corr>. After the
<m>earth</m>, only the <m>leather</m> remains neatly imprinted <span></span> of
the <span>size of a <span>pea</span></span>. And then you give the
<m>leather</m> two or three even layers of <m>copperas black</m> and
<m>iron <corr>scale</corr></m>, one after the other, like the
<span>tanners</span> do. And this <m>dye</m>, being astringent, makes the
<m>leather</m> shrink &amp; strengthens it and makes it imprint better.
Once dry, one <m>glues</m> <m>canvas</m> on the back with <m><span>colle
forte</span></m>. In this manner one can promptly imitate big statues &amp;
very delicate medals and paint &amp;
decorate them &amp; are light and portable
&amp; last a <span>long time</span>. That which is imprinted on a relief
is done differently and can be passed over again with a <m>hot
iron</m>.</div></div><div id="p057v_2"><h2><span>Painter</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">Good <span><m>crayons</m></span> are not made with <s>good</s>
