 <span>saulmons</span>, which has not been remelted since it came from the
<span>mine</span>, because the masters remelt it <s>a</s> in
<span><span>grilles</span></span>, weighing two or three <span>lb</span>, to easily
cut it up and sell it by the piece. And in this they often mix in
leftovers from <m>plates</m>, <m>solder</m> &amp; <m>common tin</m>.
And to recognise the best one, it is the most lustrous, which looks
burnished, because it is the softest. Sometimes in their
<span>saulmons</span> they find pieces of <m>iron</m>, stones, &amp; similar
things mixed in, to cheat on the weight. The <m>tin from
<span>England</span></m> is so hard that the <span>miners</span> put in
<m>lead</m> to soften it. The one that comes by way of <span>Germany</span>
is softer. Usually, the <span>sworn master pewterers</span>, from
<span><span>bonnes villes</span></span>, add six <span>lb</span> of <m>fine
lead</m> <s>on</s> or eight on a <span>quintal</span> of <m>fine
tin</m>. The <span>others, who work in the <span>countryside</span></span>,
put fifteen or 20 or as much as they can, and to cover up the blackness
of the <m>lead</m> <s>they</s> and its softness, they put in
<m>looking-glass tin</m>, 4 <span>lb</span> per <span>quintal</span>,
<mark>+</mark>, <s><span>po</span></s> which whitens &amp; hardens,
and <s>a little</s> six or eight <span>lb</span> of <m>rosette</m> on a
quintal to render the plate <span>sonorous</span>. </div><div data-layout="middle">

To mold platters &amp; dishes, they make them out of <m><span>pierre
<s><fr>porte</fr></s> morte</span></m>, that is from
<m><span>grais</span></m>, &amp; they shape &amp;polish <s>around</s>
them on the <span>wheel</span>. They melt their <m>tin</m> in an
<s><span>dest</span></s> <span><m>iron</m> posnet</span> on a
<m>charcoal</m> fire, and with an <span><m>iron</m> spoon</span> that holds
<s>almost</s> a sufficient quantity for a platter, they cast
<s><span>leu</span></s> in their <span>cold molds</span>, which they keep
joined &amp; tight between their <span>knees</span>. And soon after, they
open the <span>molds</span> so that they do not heat up, &amp; having taken
out the cast which is on the female side, &amp; which breaks easily.
Then, with a <span>cloth</span> which soaks in <m>water</m>, which they
always have beside them, they rub the middle of the back of the dish
&amp; around the edge, so that it comes out better, and they rub the
female mold.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



<mark>+</mark>

When the <m>tin is fine</m>, one adds less <m>glass-looking tin</m>,
namely 4 <span>lb</span> per <span>quintal</span>, but if the <m>tin is low
quality</m>, that is to say allied with a lot of <m>lead</m>, one puts
at least five or six <span>lb</span> of <m>looking-glass tin</m> to it.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



If there is not a lot of <m>looking-glass tin</m>, one puts about two or
three <span>lb</span> per <span>quintal</span>. One puts eight <span>lb</span> of
<m>rosette</m>. But if there is a lot of <m>looking-glass tin</m>
<s>one</s>, like 4 or 5 <span>lb</span>, one only puts six of
<m>rosette</m>. And commonly, per <span>quintal</span> of <m>tin</m>, one
adds x <span>lb</span> of both.
