a beautiful tree.</div><div data-layout="middle">One needs to leave only two shoots at maximum on the graft, for when
it has more, its strength is weakened. The wind torments it, &amp; it
does not have enough strength to bud.</div><div data-layout="middle">Trees which have coarse marrow, like <span>peach trees</span> &amp; all
their kind &amp;the <span>plum trees</span>, do not want grafts <span>in
freezing weather</span> because the cold damages their marrow, which one
also needs to protect from wounding by cutting the foot of the
graft.</div><div data-layout="middle">All grafts must not be made earlier than their tree will be sapping,
