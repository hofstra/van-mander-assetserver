Wanting to melt, always put for these two <span>metals</span>,
<corr>a</corr> <m>small stone of pulverized borax</m> at the bottom of
the <span>crucible</span> &amp; the <m>gold</m> and <m>silver</m> on top.
This makes it so that if the <span>crucible</span> renders some steam or
sour smoke, it will not impair these two <span>metals</span>. For
<m>gold</m> mainly, this is good.</div><div data-layout="middle">

If you have several <m>molds</m> to cast, do not think of filling them
in one cast, for the <m>metal</m> would be cold. But having cast while
hot &amp; filling one, remelt &amp; cast in the other. </div><div data-layout="middle">When your <span>mold</span> starts to redden on the inside, <s>&amp;

looking inside <add>the cast</add> you <s>you</s> do not see
<s><span>plas</span></s> <add>a single point</add> of blackness,
continue to maintain it in this heat &amp; if needs be, adjust it in
some half lit charcoals with your <span><span>molletes</span></span>. However,
<s><span>com</span></s> put <add>in the <span>forge</span></add> your
<span>crucible</span> with a little <m>ground borax</m> at the bottom, &amp;
the <m>silver</m> that you want to cast <s>in your
<span>forge</span></s> <add>should be on top</add>. Let your
<span>crucible</span> reheat between the lit charcoals
<s><span>jus</span></s> <s>without blowing</s> until it is red, for
before, one ought not to blow. And when you do blow, push in a long
&amp; continuous movement the <span>bellows</span>, giving them a little
shake when pushing &amp; another when pulling towards you. In this way,
the heat becomes stronger. <s><span>Com</span></s>

the <span>crucible</span>, it will cool your <m>silver</m> rather than
heating it. Make sure that the lit charcoals support it from above the
<span><span>tuelle</span></span> &amp; take care that it is at a distance of
three <span>good <span>fingers</span></span> from the wall of the
<span>forge</span>. In this way, it heats better. Therefore, when your
<m>silver</m> starts to melt, if you recognize that it is brittle,
seeing cracked &amp; burst lumps, take the <span>size of a
<span>hazelnut</span></span> of <m>arsenic &amp; <span>two times as much</span> of
raw tartar, coarsely pulverized</m>, for in this way, they have more
ability to heat. And throw it sometimes in the <span>crucible</span> on the
<m>silver</m>, which clarifies it. But if you have some of that
sublimated crust on a <m>metal</m> substance, which looks like
<span>grain</span> of <m>steel</m>, as previously described, take a little
of that, leaving <add><mark>#</mark></add> the others &amp; throw it
on your <m>melted silver</m>.</div><div data-layout="right-top">
