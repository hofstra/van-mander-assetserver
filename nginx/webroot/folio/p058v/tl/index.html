<m><span>Walnut</span> oil</m> in <span>Flanders</span> costs at least a hundred

<m><span>Azur dâ€™esmail</span></m> hates more than any other to be ground,
especially with <m>water</m>, for it dies &amp; loses all its color.
However, because it cannot be worked if it is coarse, grind not with
<m>water</m> but with <m>oil</m> &amp; grind it coarsely, and in this
way it will not die as much.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

To work well on a small scale very thin <span><span>pinceaulx</span> which

the most careful take the <m>bristles of the oldest <span>rats</span></m>,
especially of <span>dormice</span> if they can find them, &amp; put two or
three of them in the middle of the <span><span>pinceau</span></span>. These make
a straight line like a <span><m>quill</m></span> &amp; all the other
<m>hairs</m> of the <span><span>pinceau</span></span> stick to them as to the
