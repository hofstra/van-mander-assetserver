provision of, to <m>lute</m> your <span>molds</span> which <s><span>ont

reheat. Those, where one needs to burn some flower or animal, should not
be <m>luted</m>, until they have been reheated once and they have been cleaned
from <m>bones</m> &amp; <m>ashes</m> remaining inside. And having
removed the <span>clamps</span>, you have opened the two halves to see if
they have any cracks. For there is some <m>plaster </m>that is not so
hard in the fire, the one as much as the other. Moreover, there is some
which makes crusty the things which stay burning inside. And these are
imperfections that one needs to avoid, either <s>by</s> by bathing
well with <m>eau-de-vie</m> the animal before casting in the wet sand,
or mixing in more or less <m>brick</m>, or <m>alum</m>, or reheating the
<m>brick</m> more, or in place of the <m>brick</m>, mixing in
<m><span>crucible</span> bottoms</m> &amp; similar things which resist well
in the fire. Having therefore reheated your <span>mold</span> to burn it
inside, leave to cool well. And if it is neat &amp; not cracked, reput
the <span>clamps</span> &amp; <m>lute</m> it with this <m>above mentioned
<span>founders</span>’ earth</m> &amp; sprinkle a little <m>sifted ash</m>
&amp; let dry a little. But keep yourself from <m>luting</m> <s>that they are

<m>silver</m>, where there is nothing to burn inside, only need, except
when the gate &amp; vents are made, <m>luting</m> &amp; reheating once. Do not
<m>lute</m> the end of the <span>mold</span> where you want to make your gate,
rather leave it uncovered &amp; the exit of the vent as well. </div><div data-layout="middle"><add>If</add> <rub>the <span>molds</span></rub> <s>that</s> were

Take <s>the</s> therefore the first ones reheated when you cast, for
you can put several of them to reheat.</div><div data-layout="middle">Light the charcoals, firstly in the <span>forge</span>, or in some other
place nearby, &amp; having placed your <span>molds</span> on a layer of good
embers, not burning too much, to have a slow fire at the beginning, put
there &amp; adjust a little the half-lit charcoals in the

The <m>earth that <span>founders</span> use to braze or solder</m>, which

having dried &amp; <span>sieved</span> &amp; then composed it, is good for
<m>luting</m> your <span>molds</span>, because this <m>earth</m> melts rather than
cracks. And any <m>earth</m> that melts <s>is</s> cannot be lacking

If the <m>earth</m> is good, &amp; <s><span>l</span></s> does not crack

casting. Reheat with slow ease in a closed fire &amp; do not expose them
hot to the air.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

<m>Lute</m> rather thickly in two or three layers, especially right in the
joints, in order that the <m>silver</m> does not come out of the

Reheat in a <span><span>four de reverberation</span></span>.</div><div data-layout="left-bottom">

this without cracking, it will be good.</div></div></folio></body></html>
