In order that the tube does not harm, for example children, or those who
<s><span>se</span></s> have protruding or swollen hemorrhoidal
<span>veins</span>, one covers the end of the <span>tube</span> with a piece of
<m><span>chicken</span> gut</m> &amp; one folds it back over the end, &amp;
in this way, one gives the enema.</div></div><div id="p103v_2"><h2>Cast</h2><div data-layout="middle">

<m>Tin</m> retracts once thick, thus it is best to cast it thin &amp;
to make two pieces out of one, then <m>solder</m> <add>them</add> if
needs be. One uses a strong piece of <m>taffeta</m> to sieve the fine
sand, with which one first covers the medal, the <span>thickness of a
<span>teston</span></span>.</div></div><div id="p103v_3"><h2>For making colors run</h2><div data-layout="middle">

Mix <m>vinegar</m> <s>with</s> a little with <m>bile</m>, &amp; put
it <s><span>p</span></s> into a <span><m>glass</m> bottle</span>, &amp; if
you want to keep it for a long time, add some <m>salt</m> to it &amp; of
this mix some of it among your colors &amp; that will make them
run.</div></div><div id="p103v_4"><h2><m>Earwax</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">

If you take enough with the tip of an <span><span>ear</span> picker</span> &amp;
you pass it through the <m><span>foam of urine</span></m>, which is readily made by
those who have a <span>headache</span>, all the <m>foam</m> will dissipate.</div></div><div id="p103v_5"><h2><m>Enamels</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">

For recognizing well their difference and their true color by
<span>candle</span>, you need to put your <span>candle</span> behind a
<span><m>crystal</m> mirror</span>, or a <span><m>glass</m> globe or jar</span>
full of <m>water</m>, because this light is like
<span>sunlight</span>.</div></div></folio></body></html>
