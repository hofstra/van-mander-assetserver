<span>harvesters</span> beat it most often <span>at night <span>in the cool
&amp; by moonlight</span></span>. Which could not be done with another
<span>grain</span> that is wetter, for one <s>le</s> must let the
sunbeams pass through, and one scarcely beats it until the <span>sun is
approaching midday</span>. Quickly after the <span><span>millet</span></span> is
cut, one needs to plow the earth because the root eats &amp; thins it as
much as if the <span><span>millet</span></span> was still standing. The ground
where the <span><span>millet</span></span> will have been sown is quite
diminished of its fertility <s>&amp; c</s>, which one knows
<s>well</s> <span>at the next sowing</span> that one makes after that. But above
all the <m>grain</m> called
<span><span>pomole</span></span> in <span>Gascony</span> or
<span><span>baillard</span></span> in <span>
France</span>, makes, according to the common
saying, the earth shake seven <span>years</span> later. <span>Beans</span>
improve &amp; enrich the soil, as long as one lets the roots &amp; stems
rot in it.</div></div><div id="p009r_2"><h2><span>Painter</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">Some, after having laid down their color, soften it with the back of a

formulary for <span>apprentices</span>, by which they can know how much
every item of merchandise costs &amp; <s><span>co</span></s>for how much
it should be sold. The second is the waste book, where they put down in
rough what they sell daily. The third is the sales book, where they
reduce to clean copy and put the retail account of what is contained in
the waste book. The fourth is the account book, which mentions the sale,
the balanced account, the bill &amp; the term of payment, &amp; this
book <s><span>l</span></s> is taken as evidence in
