otherwise you will not <s><span>v</span></s> be able to work with it
except with great work, and even then you need to thin it with
<m>turpentine</m> to give it body, and mix it with a little <m>lead
white</m>. Any <m>azure</m> does not want to be ground or washed for it
loses color &amp; becomes wan. But putting it powdered on your
<span>palette</span>, you will thin it little by little either with
<m><span>walnut</span> oil</m> or <m>turpentine oil</m>,
<corr>dipping</corr> a <span>knife point</span> in <m>oil</m>, then

of light, very clear, the second one darker &amp; the third ones quite
strong, then blend these three shadows together by hatching them from
the darkest to the clearest.</div><div data-layout="left-middle" data-layout-hint="tall">
