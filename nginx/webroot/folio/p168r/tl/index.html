a rope wrapped around the end of a <span>stick</span>, one gives fire &amp;
promptly retreats to take cover. The small petards of 16 or 17
<span>lb</span> are attached promptly with a <span>short hooked peg</span> made
like a <span>wimble</span>, &amp; if the petard
is of a good alloy, one can give fire by <span>hand</span> just as one does
with petards of 27 <span>lb</span>, but then one only puts in three
<span>lb</span> of <m>powder</m>. It must certainly be a strong door if the
seventeen <span>lb</span> petard does not blow it up. Some use <span>little
bells</span> worn by <span>oxen</span> or <span>mules</span> on a
<span>peasant</span> door. Others load two pistol barrels &amp;, with a
<span>gimlet</span> &amp; a <span>string</span>, attach them with the muzzle
against the door. If the petards are good &amp; do not explode, they
only recoil and cannot do harm if one is next to them.</div><div data-layout="middle">A. This is a <span>small peg, hooked like the hinge of a door</span>
&amp; made like a <span><span>gimlet</span></span> on one end for quickly
attaching a small petard with ears of fifteen or xvii <span>lb</span> for a
common door or window.</div><div data-layout="middle">B. This is a small petard with ears.</div><div data-layout="middle">C. This is a <s>larg</s> common petard of 27 or 30 <span>lb</span>
pierced at the breech, through which a large <span><m>iron</m> peg</span>
passes, button-like on one end &amp; made like a
<span><span>gimlet</span></span> at the point, for quickly attaching the petard
against a door that <s>does not have</s> <add>is not</add>

for loading the petard &amp; sealing the <m>powder</m> well.</div><div data-layout="middle">E. <s>This</s> <span><m>Iron</m> fork made in the form of pincers
of the <span>height of a man</span></span>, to quickly place the mortar
without a <span>peg</span>. It must be of <m><span>doux</span> iron</m> in order
that its branches bend easily, if need be, to fit to the height or width
of the door.</div><div data-layout="middle">F. This is another <span><m>iron</m> fork</span> of the same height that
props up the <span>fork made like pincers</span> &amp; also supports the
petard, and with its claw at the bottom prevents the <span>pincers</span>
from recoiling.</div><div><i>Continued...</i></div></div></folio></body></html>
