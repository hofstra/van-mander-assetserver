<m>lead</m>, which is fatty in itself, or other <m>filings</m>, attach
to it. And you will be able to clean them either with <m>hot
charcoal</m> or a <span>wire brush made of <m>wires of
latten.</m></span></div></div><div id="p159v_2"><h2><span>Carnation</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">It is molded like the <span>rose</span>, <span>marigold</span>, &amp; all
other flowers, thus as is said, namely, whole-mold flowers, &amp; all
the leaves, if you want, in two halves, joining them by <m>solder</m>
for a more assured way, even if you could mold them together in a closed
<span>mold</span>. I cast one that came out very well. But it is necessary
that the the sand be very thin &amp; blown thoroughly.</div><div id="fig_p159v_1" data-layout="left-middle"><img alt="" classname="inline-figure" src="/bnf-ms-fr-640/figures/p159v_1.png"></div></div><div id="p159v_3"><h2><span>Molds</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">Make the two sides so that they are, <s>es</s> if it is
possible, one as thick<s>ness</s> as the other, in order that they
can be quite evenly reheated. When you mold some animal that should be
burned <s>you</s>, like <span>crayfish</span>, you cannot open it to
clean it &amp; make the cast so that it is not reheated. And when they
are reheated one time, keep them scarcely at all without casting, for
they are rendered musty &amp; moist, &amp; the <span>mold</span> is undone
&amp; loses its strength.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">


The part where the back of the animal is, is usually thicker.</div></div><div id="p159v_4"><h2><m>Plaster</m> alone</h2><div data-layout="middle">Reheated <m>stone plaster</m> <s>fears</s> is undone in
<m>water</m>, but that which is <s>reheated &amp;</s> first
pulverized and then reheated does not fear it. But if it is good it
hardens in it, like <m>the one of <span>Paris</span> &amp;
<span>Spain</span></m>, which is hard with <m>stone</m>, as is that which
grows in <span>lean &amp; dry earth</span> and which seems like <m>white
salt</m>. <span>Germans</span> make statues for their <span>fountains</span>
with it, which are not spoiled, especially once varnished, but it is
hardened in <m>water</m>. When it is alone &amp; not mixed, it takes
hold more quickly than otherwise. One needs to <m>oil</m> very lightly
your molds that are of <m>metal</m> or <m>stone</m>, otherwise it will
not release. And however you <m>oil</m>, one needs to wet it with <m>hot
water</m>. And when it will have taken hold &amp; is well cooled, one
needs to wet it sometimes in <m>cold water</m>, but if it refuses to
open, in <m>hot water</m> &amp; sometimes in <m>boiling water</m>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



Sometimes one even needs to make the <span>mold</span> boil in <m>hot
water</m>, as when you have molded some <m>wax</m> that you fear would
not be easily released from it.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">


<m>Cold water</m> makes <m>oil</m> withdraw to the surface of the
<m>plaster</m> that has sucked it in, &amp; thus it released.</div></div></folio></body></html>
