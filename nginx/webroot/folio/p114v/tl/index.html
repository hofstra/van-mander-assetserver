half-<span>mold</span> on the <span>tourtelle</span> of <s><m>earth</m></s>
<m>clay</m>, &amp; put the circle also around, &amp; make the mark for
the thickness similar to the first. Then, with another rather thickish
<span><span>pinceau</span></span>, moisten well everywhere the uncovered half
<s>&amp; belly</s> of your animal
<s><span>Et</span></s> <add>with <m>eau-de-vie</m></add>,
without leaving anything, if it is possible, which is not moistened, for
this is the secret, which makes it come out neat. And next, as promptly
as possible, before the <m>eau-de-vie</m>
<s><span>ne</span></s> evaporates, wet your sand, and throw it, in
shakes, and while blowing, &amp; moving the <span>mold</span>, as you did
for the first one, making sure that the <s><span>premier q</span></s>
first thing you pour on the animal should be a little clearer than the
next one, so that it moistens everywhere &amp;retrace the more delicate
parts. So, leave it for a <span><span>quarter hour</span></span> to set, then
remove the circle &amp; the <m>clay</m> <span>tourtelle</span>. And, with a
<span>knife</span>, arrange your two <span>molds</span> uniformly together in a
long shape of a <span>mandore</span>, as mentioned, because of the cast.
Then dip a little the whole <span>mold</span> evenly, at the level of the
joints, in <m>water</m>, for this is another secret to unjoin them,
otherwise you will break everything. Separate them nimbly, therefore, by
this means, and next, extract gently &amp; with patience and immediacy
the half of the animal remaining in one of the <span>molds</span>,
<s>for</s> pulling it sometimes from one side &amp; sometimes from
the other, to avoid breaking any of it, or also spoiling something from
your <span>mold</span>. <s><span>Et</span></s> The latter being empty,
<s><span>retire</span></s> rejoints the two halves so that no dust
enters it, &amp; put them aside until you want to reheat them, make a
cast &amp; vents, &amp; place <span>clamps</span>. As for the animal, so
that it does not dry &amp; that you might be able to mold it four of
five times, put in in <m>water</m>. And I think that it would keep even
better in <m>eau-de-vie</m>. However, the best would be to mold
in the same <span>day</span> the 4 or 5 <span>molds</span> that you can do,
because these infected animals themselves are <span>stinky</span> in one
<span><span>day</span></span>. Having left your <span>molds</span> one or two
<s><span>es</span></s> <span><span>days</span></span> to dry, for they stay
damp for a good <span><span>month</span></span>, make the vents on one
half.<figure>

<mark>+</mark> Note that when you have made your second
<add>cast</add>, if you leave your <span>mold</span>, for one
<span><span>day</span></span> or a <span><span>night</span></span>, without opening
it, you would need to then dip it in <m>hot water</m>, or else reheat it
before opening it, as for <span>crabs</span>.</div><div data-layout="left-top">



If after both halves of the noyau have made a strong &amp; hard set, you
would not dip your <span>mold</span> in <m>water</m>, it would not unjoin at
all. But as you dip the reverse of the <span>mold</span> in <m>water</m>,
the imbibed <m>oil</m> collects at the top &amp; at the level of the
joints &amp; and makes it separate.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



However, take heed your second <span>mold</span> be of good thickness &amp;
that it is hard enough because if it is lacking in this, after having
dipped it in <m>water</m>, &amp; you want to open it, there is a risk
that it breaks. Take heed therefore to avoid this, and wanting to open
it, dip all of it in <m>water</m>, <add>and rub it everywhere</add>,
where it will harden if it has set well.Then, take your two
<span>molds</span>, joined with a <span>rough <m>linen</m> cloth</span>, in in
order to have a better grip, and separate them with strength as if you
wanted to quarter a loaf of <m>bread</m>. But if happens to break, join
it &amp; on the reverse, strenghten the joints with <span>clamps</span>.
