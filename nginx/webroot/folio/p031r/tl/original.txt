<ab>Their <tl>hammers</tl> must be quite even &amp; polished, and if in
some unfortunate case the rust, <del>the</del> or some other use, has
damaged them, they first polish them with <m>emery stone powder</m>,
then they finish burnishing &amp; smoothing with the <m>putty</m>.
Otherwise they would not strike neatly. It is also necessary that the
face of the <tl>anvils</tl> be the same.</ab>

<ab>Being well taken, if you want it to grow strong branches, having
plowed it, put at each foot two <ms>handfuls</ms> of <m><al>pigeon</al>

<head>Colored waters</head>

<ab><m><bp>Distilled urine</bp></m>, <m>distilled vinegar</m> and
<m>eau-de-vie</m> take on a blue and green color from <m>pulverized and
finely ground <la>aes ustum</la></m>. And this colored water is <m>red
copper</m> in its residue if you distil the aforesaid things through a
<tl>filter</tl>.</ab>

<ab><m><pl>Flanders</pl> varnish</m>, made with <m>turpentine</m> &amp;
<m>oil</m> from this or from <m>mastic</m>, can come off and does not
hold up <env>in the rain</env>. But that made with <m><fr>huile de noix
blanche</fr></m>, as you have done, holds <env>in the rain</env> and is
very clear &amp; beautiful &amp; dries soon. This is why one uses this
one for painted banners &amp; signs that one carries <env>in the
rain</env>.</ab>

<head>Fruit made from <m>sugar</m></head>

<ab>One does not paint them with a <tl><fr>pinceau</fr></tl> like other
<del><fr>s</fr></del> things with moistened color, because the
<m>sugar</m> would melt. But one rubs them with color with the
<tl><bp>finger</bp></tl>.</ab>
