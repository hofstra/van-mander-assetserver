without spoiling it. <s>And</s> And having dried it &amp; cleaned it
with a <span><m>linen</m></span>, &amp; <span>small bristle brushes of
<span>pork</span></span>, I once again lightly anointed it with <m>clear
<span>walnut</span> oil</m>, &amp; gently passed a <span><m>linen</m></span>
over it, so that it does not remain too anointed, and I noted that,
by this means, it would come out better in release, because the
<m>ceruse</m>, once moistened with <m>water of glair of egg</m>, would not
attach to the <m>oil</m>. This worked very well and I molded a medal of
high relief very neatly, without making any stickiness, which a lot of
good sands, such as <m>felt</m>, <m>burnt bone</m> &amp; <m>iron
dross</m>, had failed to do on the first try. I reheated it &amp; my
<span>mold</span> became hard like <m>marble</m>, and I realized with this,
that sands for molding high relief should be well moistened with some
<m>water</m>, which gives them body &amp; compactness, like <m>glair of egg</m>, <m>gummed water</m>, <s><span>ea</span></s> <m>wine boiled
with <span>elm root</span></m>, &amp; and lightly <m>oil</m> the medal, it
withstands as many castings as you wish, for it is as hard as
<m>glass</m>. But even <m>soft lead</m> &amp; <m>brittle tin</m>

excellent &amp; endures many castings &amp; molds very neatly, it is
however fat and makes things porous. This, <m>soft lead</m> <s>and

sand</m>, such as <m>pumice</m>, <m>flakes</m>, &amp; similar things, to
give them body, &amp; so that they release better. For <m>lean sands</m>
barely release well and yet they receive <m>metal</m> well.</div><div data-layout="left-top">
