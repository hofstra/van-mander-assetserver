<span>mine</span></m> finely ground on <span><m>marble</m></span> </h2><div data-layout="middle">The one and the other, once very finely ground on
<span><m>marble</m></span>, after having thoroughly <span>pestled</span> them dry &amp; beaten
in the <span>mortar</span>, I mixed as much of one as the other, and having
reworked them together on <span><m>porphyry</m></span>, &amp; passed them
through a <span>double sieve</span> or through the <span>sleeve of a
shirt</span> to mix them even better, I put them in <span><m>paper</m></span>
&amp; put them on a <span><m>marble</m></span> in a <span>cellar</span>. After
one <span><span>night</span></span>, they had been been moistened enough by
themselves without dampened them further, because <m>rock salt</m>, like
all other <m>salts</m>, dissolves <span>in dampness</span>. I molded very
neatly with it, because both were very finely ground. They want to be
<s><span>f</span></s> humid enough to release well.</div></div><div id="p088v_2"><h2>Mineral sand</h2><div data-layout="middle">It does not matter if the color is white or yellow. Above all it
must be in one piece, &amp; as if taken from a <span>quarry</span> or
<span>rock formation</span>, &amp; the deeper one takes it from, the
better. The signs of its goodness is that it is thus amassed, and that
when removing in the form of <m>rock</m>, it comes out in lumps &amp;
<s><span>qu</span></s> pieces which demonstrates its bond, &amp; that it
is not too lean.</div><div data-layout="middle">However, it should <span>break apart between your
<span><span>hands</span></span></span> &amp; have very small
<s><span>men</span></s> &amp; delicate grains &amp; of the same nature.
If it is not delicate enough, you can pass &amp; grind it finely, either
through <m>water</m>, or through a <span>sieve</span>, <s>&amp; when
it</s> or on the <span><m>porphyry</m></span>, &amp; in this way, from
<s><span>sil</span></s> leanness they become fat &amp; well bound. You
can mold with it in a <s><span>sa</span></s> <span>frame</span> or in a
<span>noyau</span> without <m>cloth waste</m>, &amp; try it with
<m>lead</m>, for if with this one it does not become porous &amp; casts
neatly, it will also behave well with <m>copper</m>. Some say that the
<m>fat sands</m> do not want the <m>metal</m> to be cast too hot.
<span>Artisans who work on big works</span> &amp; to save time, do not
need to grind &amp; seek the curiosities of <m>artificial sands</m>,
benefit from seeking some ready made in <span>nature</span>, which has the
finest grain possible, &amp; for small works, they only pass it only
through a <span>sieve</span>. But those who work in small works, finely
grind it &amp; grind it impalpable, because they do not need a lot of
it.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

<m><span><span>Orber√© grain</span></span></m> makes a tawny powder, very
delicate &amp; very soft, which once mixed could <s>mix</s> mold
very neatly. Try <m><span>wheat</span> flour</m> burned over a closed
fire.</div></div></folio></body></html>
