carefully all the joints, as much as above &amp; below as on the sides,
having not forgotten to notch the joints of the <span>molds</span>, as with
others. Having <span>clamped</span> it all, undo the <span>clamps</span> on the
side &amp; not the others. And thus, your <span>mold</span> of several
pieces <s><span>sem</span></s> will open as if it were only in two
halves. If you want to mold hollow, make in the middle of the <s>of
the part</s> <span>mold</span> of the belly a hole, from side to side,
which, inside, is <span>of such capacity that the end of a <span>little
finger</span> can almost enter it</span>, widening like a <span>clervoise</span>
the outside of the hole. This is to cast the <span>noyau</span>. But, note
that <corr>all</corr> these difficulties would be nothing if you wanted
to mold hollow because you could mold your <span>turtle</span> in two pieces
<s><span></span></s> and burn it inside, as with other animals, and it
would be done quickly. But since the <span>turtle</span> is massive &amp;
that it is weighty, without being hollow, one considers better molded in
this way, <add>hollow</add>, and in <s><span>cha</span></s> this fashion, to
make well a <span>mold</span>, one really needs <span>three
<span>days</span></span>. Take heed, for hollow &amp; fanciful
<span>molds</span>, to have some <m>strong plaster</m>, which endures the
fire without bursting, if it is possible. But, if you cannot have any
such, mix a little more <m><span>alum de plume</span></m> &amp; add to it
also some <m><span>crocum</span></m>, which fortifies it &amp; makes so the
flashing, if there is any, comes out so finely that it is easily undone.
Also do not forget to tighten well, with a <span>press</span>, your
<span>molds</span>, to avoid flashing which is made either when the
<span>mold</span> is not well joined or when it bursts. To repair, if the
features are not apparent enough, retrace them lightly with a
<span>burin</span>, then soften them with a <span>small chisel</span>. The flashing
is removed with the <span><span><span>chaple</span></span></span>, a type of
<span>burin</span>. For the lumps &amp; scales, they are made either with a
<span>little gouge</span> or a <span>little round cutting-punch</span>, or with
the <span>point of a small chisel</span>, not tempered &amp; struck on a
<span>small file</span>. </div><div data-layout="left-middle">Make this hole before <s>molding</s>
