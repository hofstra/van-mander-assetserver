they trace the nose &amp; the mouth with black in small work, then they
make strokes &amp; and highlights in white, next they coat all with
carnation. And as for the ground, they make it with <m>azur
dâ€™<span>Acre</span></m> for more beauty, or with <m>lake for a quickly-done
red</m>, or with <m><span>dragon</span>'s blood</m> for the most beauty. But
one needs to layer it little by little so that it appears even &amp; of
one color, &amp; thus for other colors. Next they put underneath it a
<m>foil backing for <m>topaz</m>, or one of <m>gold</m> or
<m>silver</m></m>.</div></div><div id="p102v_2"><h2>Infusion of <m><span>anthos</span></m> or

quantity you like and put it into a <span>bottle</span>

leave it to rest three or four <span><span>days</span></span>; and next express the
whole into another <span>vessel</span> &amp; into this very same

seven or eight <span>infusions</span> of new flowers. Next, leave the last

Next, distil it through an <span>alembic</span>. <s>Ne</s>, And take ii

thick, because being thick &amp; in great heat, it retracts. Therefore,
if you want to mold a thick piece in <m>tin</m>, mold it only on one
side, &amp; with a cavity on one side, if it is possible, in that way
you will have it more neat, and then you will be able to <m>solder</m>
two halves together. But if you have to mold it thick, make it in the
form &amp; mold a lot of feeders around the figure, in this
way.
