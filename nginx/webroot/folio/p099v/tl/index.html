<m>metal</m> because the substance is brittle &amp; frangible. But one
<s><span>z</span></s> ought not to push the <span>borer</span> with too
great a force nor continue all in one push, but pull it out often. In
that case, one makes the <s>touch-hole</s> <add>muzzle of the
cannon</add> bigger than the ball in order to avoid the necessity of
<span>boring</span>, because the substance is cast &amp; expands &amp;
pushes the mold. The <span>borer</span> should be neither like a swallow
tail, nor a point, but should cut in the round like a <span>wimble</span>.
If it breaks, one ought not to leave it there to rust

you will do by pouring a little <m>oil</m> on it; then
<s><span>l</span></s> turn the place of the touch-hole downwards &amp;
strike the opposite side of the piece, &amp; it will fall down. One
needs to <span>bore</span> gently &amp; at ease when the piece is of
