it as well with a little <m>red copper</m>, and when you want to cast, a
little <m>tin</m> to make it runnier. It always leaves a tail like

others.</div></div><div id="p154v_2"><h2>Molding</h2><div data-layout="middle">It is only good that it die down a little on the outside, &amp;
nevertheless be red on the inside, for when it comes out of the fire,
the air &amp; strong exhalations of heat do not receive the cast so
well.</div></div><div id="p154v_3"><h2>The casting <add>of <m>silver</m></add></h2><div data-layout="middle"><m>Silver</m> needs a longish gate. For <m>gold</m> it does not
