Keep stirring it continuously until it returns once again to being heavy

<mark>#</mark> remains reheated, &amp; <s><span>plus</span></s> the

One ought not reheat it until you want to mold. And to reheat it, put
it, as finely ground raw powder, in a <span>cauldron</span> on
<s>ash</s> a clear flame &amp; do not make it neither too strong nor
too violent. Always stir with a long <span>stick</span>, to avoid the vapor,
turning it around the <span>cauldron</span> &amp; in the middle, in a figure
8. At the beginning, you will find it heavy <s>difficult</s> to
stir, because it is full of moisture. As it heats up, it will start to
throw off some bubbles at the edge of the <span>cauldron</span>. And finally
it will become like liquid &amp; as it were mealy &amp; like bran &amp; boiling in
the middle. Continue to stir continuously until you recognize that it
has once again become heavy
