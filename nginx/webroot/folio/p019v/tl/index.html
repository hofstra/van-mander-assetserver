Mathematical figures without <span>ruler</span> or <span>compass</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">

You know how to draw a circle correctly with the <span>quill</span> &amp; or
else with the <span><span>nail of your right thumb</span></span> &amp; the bent
<span><span>big finger</span></span>. If you do not have a <span>ruler</span>, fold
<m>paper</m> in two five or six times to use it. And if you want to draw
a column, arch, oval, escutcheon correctly without a <span>compass</span>,
fold your <m>paper</m> such that the fold <s><span>e</span></s> gives
you a straight line, at the <span>required distance</span> from which, trace
a point <s>&amp; a</s> or a line &amp; saturate it well with
<m>ink</m>. Then fold again the <m>paper</m> &amp; rub it on the back
&amp; it will stamp however much you have made. In that way <s><span>la
l</span></s>, A is the line without <m>ink</m> which the <m>paper</m>
fold gives you, B is the line you have traced, C is the one which is
stamped.

left as from the right</h2><div data-layout="middle">

Write as best you can with <m>well-gummed ink</m> on as many little
<m>cards</m> as you want <s><span></span></s> to write words. &amp; once
each letter is well saturated with <m>ink</m>, put it down on your
<m>paper</m> &amp; rub with a <span>tooth</span> the back of the
<m>card</m>.</div></div><div id="p019v_3"><h2>Enemas</h2><div data-layout="middle">

One used to give them with <span><m>leather</m> sleeves or bags</span>,
which for the best result <s>is</s> must be of <m><span>cat</span>
skin</m> which is more mitten-like than any other. And then one would
start to fold back the <span>sleeve</span> on one side &amp; one would
continue to fold it back &amp; twist it around itself &amp; in that way
the enema would run gently. But this manner takes longer &amp; is less
convenient than the <span>syringe</span> which has been discovered since,
with which a single man easily gives himself an enema. It is true that
it always causes wind at the end.</div></div></folio></body></html>
