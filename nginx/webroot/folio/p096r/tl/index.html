<span>round plane, also mounted with two handles</span>, then with a
<span>small narrow plane</span>, one hollows &amp; scrapes it <span>half a
<span>foot</span></span> towards the end of the
<span>talan</span>, and the shorter the better.
Without this scraping, the sword would always cut the scabbard.</div><div data-layout="middle">

The opening of the scabbard is called the mouth &amp; on top is the
shape of the blade.</div><div data-layout="middle">

The stop, which is a <m>leather</m> rim set on the edge of the blade
shape is made to stop the hangers.</div><div data-layout="middle">

When the <span>estelles</span> are well levelled, one lays the sword on top
&amp; with a <span><m>black stone</m></span> one marks the width of the
blade, &amp; the length, &amp; then with a <span>chisel</span> one cuts the
excess. And one passes a <span><span>joiners</span>â€™ plane</span> to even it
well, according to the mark.</div><div data-layout="middle">

Next, one glues the two <span>estelles</span> edge to edge <add>and all
around</add> only as far as the shape of the blade extends &amp; not
elsewhere. And this is to make the <m>leather</m> or <m>velvet</m> of
the scabbard hold.</div><div data-layout="middle">

Then one puts the sword into the <span>estelles</span>. And precisely thus
they set it in the scabbard which is all sewn, and rub what is
<m>glued</m> along the shape of the blade
with <m>tallow</m> to make it run into the scabbard.</div><div data-layout="middle">

The scabbard is made of <m><span>calf</span> or <span>sheep</span> leather</m>,
the <span>calf</span> ones are all in one piece, but not the <span>sheep</span>
ones. But, when the swords are long, one makes them in pieces which are
sewn between <m>leather</m> &amp; <m>flesh</m>, &amp; then they rub the
stitching thoroughly with a piece of <span><m><span>boxwood</span></m></span> to
cover &amp; even it. From a <m>good <span>calf</span> skin</m>, viii or 9 or
x scabbards can be taken. A
<span>workman</span> can easily make vi <span>a <span>day</span></span>. If they
are too thick, one thins them a little with a <span>plane</span>. If the
<m>skin</m> is hard, one wets it in <m>lightly lukewarm water</m>, and
one does not leave it <corr>there</corr> for long. Next, the same
<span>worker who made the <m>wood</m>piece</span> has to adjust the
scabbard to be well made. It is true that for <span>common people</span>,
one may well get ones which are ready made, but they are never carried
as well. When the scabbard is made &amp; sewed with <m>black thread</m>,
one rubs it with a piece of <span><m><span>boxwood</span></m></span> or with a
<span>cloth</span>, having daubed it a little in <m>oil</m>. The scabbard of
a good <span>cow</span> is better than any and also costs more, except the
<m>velvet</m> kind. Under the <m>velvet</m> one commonly puts <m>plain
canvas</m> or a <span>sheep</span> scabbard or a <m>parchment</m> cover. But
the best scabbard of all is a <m>waxed</m> scabbard, of either
<m>velvet</m> or <span>calf</span>. It is because one covers the <m>wood</m>
with <m>thin canvas</m>, which one next <m>waxes</m>, then one covers it
in <m>velvet</m> or <span>calf</span>. A <m>waxed</m> scabbard is worth at
least xxx <span><span><span>sols</span></span></span>, a <span>cow</span> one xx
<span><span><span>sols</span></span></span>.</div><div data-layout="left-bottom">
