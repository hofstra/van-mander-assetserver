<span>women</span> can see the <span>secret places</span> that they do not
want to show to <span>surgeons</span>. It casts the representation out of
itself, and if you <span>touch</span> <s><span>le lieu</span></s> the eye of
the representation with your <span>finger</span>, another <span>finger</span>
will come against yours.</div><div data-layout="middle">You will make a light <span>at night</span> for someone quite far
away, if you place the <span>concave mirror</span> behind a <span>candle</span>
placed on the <span><span>window</span></span>. You can read and write quite
far from the <span>candle</span> if you place it behind the <span>candle</span>
&amp; place <add>&amp; turn</add> the concavity towards you. If you put
the <span>mirror</span> <span>at the end of a <span>table</span></span> &amp; a
<span>candle</span> on it, it will represent two lights on the
<span>table</span> for you. To see what is happening on a <span>street</span>,
shutter the <span>window</span>, and the more you can shut there the
better. Make a hole at the lower pane, as wide as your <span><span>little
finger</span></span>, perfectly round, from one side to the other. Then
place a <span>sheet of <m>paper</m></span> on the <span><span>window</span></span>
&amp; let the <span>middle of the <span>sheet</span></span> be over the hole.
Pierce the <span>sheet</span> in the same place as the hole &amp; the same
size. After, aim the concave face of the <span>mirror</span> towards the
hole, &amp; it will represent for you anyone passing by in the
<span>street</span> on the <span>sheet of <m>paper</m></span>. Similarly with
the <span>pierced door of a closed room</span>. You can make wavy ones
&amp; triangular ones, in the fashion described by <span>Ptolemy</span> &amp;
<span>Archimedes</span>. The concave one also sets fire to <m>straw</m>,
lights a <span><m>candle</m></span> from afar, using the <span>sun</span>. By
reverberating fire too, it heats.</div></div><div id="p005v_1"><h2>For bronzing in yellow and white</h2><div data-layout="middle">Take <m>looking-glass tin</m> and melt it. On <span>half a lb</span> of
