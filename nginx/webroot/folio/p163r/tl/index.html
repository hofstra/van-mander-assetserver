the white layers &amp; <s><span>pour l</span></s> which gives a more
severe <span>scent</span>. But to remove <s><span>la</span></s> or hide the
blackness of the <m>musk</m>, they put in a little of <m><span>wheat</span>
starch from <span>England</span></m>, which is perfectly white.</div><div data-layout="middle"><s>When the <m>amber</m></s>To make a perfume of <m>white
amber</m> in the fashion of those in <span>Portugal</span>, take a
<span>huchau</span> of <m>amber</m> well broken up. And having put in a
<span>small <m>silver</m> bowl</span> a <s><m>silver</m></s>
<span><span>spoonful</span></span> of <m>flower oil</m>, or lacking that,
<m><span>Ben</span> oil</m>, that is to say, a <span><span><m>silver</m>
spoon</span> that one uses at the table</span>, put in your
<m>ambergris</m> &amp; place all on a low fire, and it will melt quickly
if your <m>amber</m> is good, &amp; it will remain there without lumps.
Once all melted, put in <span>the size of a <span>pinon</span></span> of
<m>civet</m>, &amp; make it melt &amp; mix it well together. Next, take
your <span>gloves</span>, well-cleaned &amp; well-dried, &amp; dipping the
<span>tip of your <span>finger</span></span> very lightly <s>on</s> on the
edge of the <m>oil</m>, spread it on the <span>glove</span> little by little
&amp; with patience &amp; rub the <span>glove</span> between your
<span>hands</span>, &amp; trace the fingers &amp; the stitches, one after
the other. And leave it to dry. Next, trace again as before until the
<m>amber</m> is all laid down.</div></div><div id="p163r_2"><h2><m>Eau-de-vie</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">It is excellent for molding neatly, such that in the place where you
do not put any, the sand will usually attack the figure. But it needs to
be in three passes. And because it does not take easily on <m>oiled</m>
things, I believe that it would be good to put some amongst the
<m>water</m> in which you wet your sand.</div></div></folio></body></html>
