<span>turtle</span>, for you will use this <m>earth</m> as <m>cement</m>, if
you need to embed something or repair with the <span>small chisel</span>. If
there is some flashing at the joints of the <span>mold</span>, you will remove
it, either with the <span>burin</span>, called a
<span><span><span>chaple</span></span></span>, or a <span>very sharp pen-knife</span>,
or with a <span>small file</span>, &amp; then with the <span>small
chisel</span>, always having the natural thing, to do this better, in
front of you. You can curl on a <span>file</span> the point of a <span>small
chisel</span>, which is not quenched, to make something lumpy. For these
<s>two</s> <span>turtles</span> &amp; other hollow things, that
presuppose being large enough, cast your alloy of <span>half</span>
<m>lead</m> &amp; <span>half</span> <m>fine tin</m>. There is more work in
molding a <span>turtle</span> than for twelve <span>molds</span> of flowers. If
there is some <m><span>crocum</span></m> in your sand, there will not be
flashing &amp; if, by some chance, there is some on the sides, it will be
thinner than <m>paper</m>, as long as your <span>mold</span> is tightened
well with a <span>press</span>. And to make the scales of <span>turtles</span>
or other animals, you can make some <span>little small chisels</span>, in
the fashion of a <span>round cutting-punch</span>, others in the fashion of a
<span>gouge</span>, or the scale of a <span>snake</span> &amp; <span>lizard</span>,
and others on a <span>file</span> to make the curly &amp; lumpy bits. The
<span>turtles</span>, which are not molded hollow, do not have as much work,
for they are molded in two pieces to repair them, with <span>small
chisels</span>, <span>small cutting-punches</span>, <span>small gouges</span>
&amp; <span>small serrated chisels</span>.</div><div id="fig_p151v_1" data-layout="left-middle"><img alt="" classname="inline-figure" src="/bnf-ms-fr-640/figures/p151v_1.png"></div></div><div id="p151v_1"><h2><m><span>Wheat</span> oil</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">One needs to make it between two quite <span>sparkling hot <m>iron

And then you will place the other, all red, on top, &amp; you will press
it until you see the <m>black oil</m> drip well. Reiterate that until
you have enough of it. This <m>oil</m> dries immediately. It gives gold

<m>gilded</m> things, serves as a <m>varnish</m> on <m>iron</m> for

coloring.
