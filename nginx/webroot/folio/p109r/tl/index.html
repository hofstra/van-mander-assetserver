little <m>butter</m>, which <s><span>sont pl</span></s> renders the
<m>wax</m> more amiable, and more appropriate than the <m>tallow</m>
that the <span>Italians</span> put in, because one has to, often, put the
<span>tools</span> in the <span>mouth</span>, which are better in <m><span>box

melted, in a <span>spoon</span> or <span>crucible</span>, &amp; they pour some
in the <m>melted wax</m>. And the <m>sulphur</m> going to the bottom or
remaining on top, it leaves &amp; mixes only its substance amongst the

having molded, it melts in the mold gently, like butter, without leaving
any gently melts in the <span>mold</span> like <m>butter</m>, without

much fire.</div><div data-layout="left-top">If</div></div><div id="p109r_3"><h2>Molding <m>wax</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">In order that your <span>mold</span> grips, without repelling in any place, on
a shape or image of <m>wax</m>, one needs to anoint it with <m>oil</m>
and moisten your sand with <m>lukewarm water</m>, for the <m>cold
water</m> would furthermore repel the <m>oil</m> &amp; would not make a
good ground on it.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



Anoint well, very lightly, with <m>oil</m>, so little that it hardly
appears. Then rub with some <m>eau-de-vie</m>. Next, moisten your sand
with <m>lukewarm water</m> so that it does not repel the

secure them from above. It is necessary that the <span>tuelle</span> be 4

their teeth if you want to keep them. For, having had their teeth
removed, they get sore gums &amp; mouth, &amp; can no longer eat. You
can keep them in a <span>barrel</span> full of <m>bran</m> or even better of
<m>earth</m>, <span>in a cool place</span>, or in a <span><m>glass</m>
