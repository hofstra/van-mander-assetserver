as <m>copper for cauldrons</m>, which is better than
<m><span>rosette</span></m>, in order that it withstands the blow better.</div><div data-layout="middle">Also the <span>mortars</span> for pestling are stronger &amp; less in

<span>private home</span>, they do not <span>ring</span> so much &amp; do not
carry as much <span>noise</span> as those of
<m>metal</m>. It is true that those that are

when it is too burned, it does not mold so neatly, because it does not
have body, and is too lean. You can give some with <m>tripoly</m> or

like <span>the <span>apothecaries</span>â€™ double</span>, without finely
grinding it further on the <span><m>porphyry</m></span>, as I have done
previously. I moistened it with <m>wine boiled with <span>elm</span>

<m>Sand from a mine</m>, well chosen &amp; well reheated, is the most
excellent of all, without looking for any other mixtures, because it
receives all <m>metals</m>. It does not want to be used hot, because it
makes things porous. The most finely ground for big works is not the
best, because it does have enough body to withstand</div><div><i>Continued...</i></div></div></folio></body></html>
