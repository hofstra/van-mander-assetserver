<ab>They mix viii <ms>lb</ms> <add>or ten</add> of <m>lead</m>, per
<ms>quintal</ms> of <m>tin</m> in <env>cities where they are <pro>sworn
masters</pro></env>. But elsewhere, they add as much as they can. One
also uses ii <ms>lb</ms> of <m>looking glass tin</m> to bind it &amp;
three <ms>lb</ms> of <m>debris</m>, that is to say the <m>copper shards
that <pro>coppersmiths</pro> make</m>. This makes the plate more
<sn>sonorous</sn> and it is not as breakable.</ab>

This <m>tin</m> is called <m>common tin</m>.</ab>

<ab>To keep it from pushing back, it is necessary to clean your arquebus
<ms>every eight days</ms>, &amp; rub it with <m>oil</m>, &amp; when you
fire, wet some <m>linen cloth</m> in <m>oil</m> &amp; put it in instead
of <m>paper</m>.</ab><comment>c_044r_02</comment>

<ab>To test it, soak it &amp; apply it to <m>paper</m>, &amp; if one or

<ab>The <m><pa>red poppy</pa></m>, which grows amongst <pa>grains</pa>,
makes a very beautiful columbine on <m>white leather</m>. The
<m><pa>cornflower</pa></m> makes a very beautiful blue. A <m>plant which
grows in hedges, which has a stem similar to <pa>flax</pa>, a long &amp;
broad leaf like small <pa>bugloss</pa>, which has a violet flower
verging on blue &amp; is shaped like the <pa>lily flower</pa></m>, makes
a very beautiful turquin, surpassing azure. Another flower, the
<m><pa>columbine</pa></m>, of the shape &amp; size of the
<m><pa>bugloss</pa> flower</m>, which has a petal like that of the
<m><pa>pansy</pa></m>, also makes a very beautiful turquin. It grows
amongst <pa>grains</pa>, in light soils.</ab>
