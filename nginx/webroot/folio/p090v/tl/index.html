<span>Lombardy</span>, make <span>square wooden cases</span>, a little larger at
the bottom than at the top, and thereon affix <span>buckles</span> on the
sides for transporting them with <span>straps</span>, as one carries gout
sufferers, because the wheels with which one could make them roll spoil
the pathways of the <span>gardens</span>. And <span><span>every two
years</span></span>, they do not forget to open the sides of the
<span>cases</span> for paring &amp; dexterously cutting, including the soil,
the ends of the <span>orange tree</span>'s roots, because otherwise, as they
find the wood, they contract &amp; fold back on themselves &amp; dry at
the tips, &amp; would make the tree die. But as they are pared, it
preserves for them new space <s><span>cos</span></s>for expanding,
without finding resistance from the wood that inhibits them. And know
that, for this effect, it would be better to join the sides of the
<span>cases</span> with <span>screws</span> &amp; not with <span>nails</span>, in
order to not shake the <m>soil</m> when one opens them.</div></div></folio></body></html>
