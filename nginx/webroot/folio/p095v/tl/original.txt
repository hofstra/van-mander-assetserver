<ab>The end<comment>c_095v_03</comment> is bought ready-made by the
<ms>dozen</ms> which costs of six <ms><cn><fr>sols</fr></cn></ms> for
the small ones, but for the the big ones 2
<ms><cn><la>caroli</la></cn></ms>.The end <del>this</del> is put either
with <tl>nails</tl> which are put on the sides of the cutting edge, but
this only spoils the sword &amp; destroys the scabbard because the
<m>water</m> enters through the join of the <tl>nail</tl>. It is best to
apply <m>resin</m> or <m>glue</m> on it, but the <m>resin</m> is better.
And it is best when the end is well adjusted &amp; set so hot that the
<m>pulverized resin</m> melts on the end. In this way, it does not fall
and cannot be undone unless it is put in the fire.</ab>

<ab>Guards are of several kinds:<lb/>

Worked<comment>c_095v_04</comment><lb/>

Guttered which is with round moldings<lb/>

<m>Pearled</m><lb/>

Scarfed when the bands are crosswise<lb/>

Onioned which is with a flat head<comment>c_095v_05</comment><lb/>

In the <pro><pn>King</pn></pro>'s manner, which are plain</ab>

<ab>The <pro>furbishers</pro> buy them by <ms>dozens</ms>, the
<ms>dozen</ms> of plain ones commonly costs x <ms><cn>lb</cn></ms>. The
worked piece, 30 <ms><cn><fr>sols</fr></cn></ms> or depending on its
fashion.</ab>

<ab>The first thing the <pro>apprentice</pro> does is to furbish as
said.</ab>

<ab>And next, to garnish the sword &amp; make a scabbard which is the
height of the art.</ab>

<ab>They buy <m>wood</m> pieces for scabbards which are ready made, of
<m><pa>beech</pa> wood</m>, a hundred for xv or xx or 30
<ms><cn><fr>sols</fr></cn></ms>, depending on the distance to the place
where they are made.</ab>

<ab>Theses <m>wood</m> pieces are thus called
<df><fr>estelles</fr></df><comment>c_095v_06</comment>, and have to be
very neat &amp; without any knots &amp; are one <ms><bp>finger</bp>â€™s
thickness across</ms>.</ab>

<ab>Then the <pro>furbisher</pro> puts them on a small bench, called a
<df><tl>scabbard bench</tl></df> and with a <del><fr>e</fr></del>
<add><fr>g</fr></add> <del><tl>plane</tl></del> <tl>small <m>iron</m>
tool</tl> similar to that of the <tl><pro>joiners</pro>' bench</tl>,
they hold it firmly. Then with a <del><tl>plane</tl></del>
<tl>plane</tl> which is like a <tl>knife with two
handles</tl><comment>c_095v_07</comment>, one works the <m>wood</m>
roughly from the top, next one passes the <tl><pro>joiner</pro>'s
