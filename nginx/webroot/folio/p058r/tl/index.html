faces in <m>oil</m>. And at the beginning, one puts the black and umber
where it is appropriate. Next, the <corr>heightening</corr> with <m>lead
white</m> must not be put on the black. Flesh colors and <span></span> with
<m>ceruse</m> going in will yellow in five or six <span>months</span>, but
<m>lead white</m> does not change.</div><div data-layout="middle"><m><span>Florence</span> lake</m> is better than the kind from
<span>Flanders</span> for in <span>Florence</span> the best dyes are made. To
make a beautiful flesh color, the reddest &amp; liveliest <m>lake</m> is
the best, for the kind that contains <m>purpurine</m> &amp;
violet, by admixture of too much <m>alum</m>, makes flesh color like
that of one who is very cold. That is why ladies, wanting to color their
<span>cheeks</span>, ground <m><span>Florence</span> lake</m> very finely, then
fill a little <span><m><span>cotton</span></m></span> with it, which they next
wrap in a little <span><m>fabric of <span>Cambray</span></m></span> which is
clear. And thus they pounce the <m>lake</m> on their <span>cheeks</span>
&amp; then, with another clean <span><m><span>cotton</span></m></span>, they
soften it.</div><div data-layout="middle"><m><span>Cristallin</span></m> having been ground with <m>water</m>
appears to <s>be</s> have body, but with <m>oil</m> it does not have
any. It is ground with <m>lake</m> &amp; with <m>asphaltum</m>, which
would not dry for a <span>very long time</span> without this.</div><div data-layout="middle"><m><span>Spike lavender</span> oil</m> is commonly put with <m>lead
white</m>, <s><span>d</span></s> not entirely pure but mixed with a
little <m><span>walnut</span> oil</m>. The said <m><span>spike lavender</span>
oil</m> would not be good for <m>lake</m> &amp; colors that do not have
body <add>for it would make them crack</add>, but with those that have
body &amp; are somewhat greasy, it is quite appropriate.</div><div data-layout="middle"><m>Verdigris</m> and <m>orpiment</m> must first be ground with
<m><span>urine</span></m> rather than thinning them with <m>oil</m>. Thus they are
beautiful &amp; do not die.</div></div></folio></body></html>
