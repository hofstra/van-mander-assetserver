<m><span>horse</span> dung</m>. <m><span>Potter</span>'s earth</m> would be
too fat and would crack &amp; would not hold in the fire, but one needs
to mix it with <span>half the quantity</span> of sand and a <span>quarter</span>
or a <span>fifth</span> of <m><add><span>horse</span></add> dung</m>. And leave
it to dry, then turn it to powder, then <span>sift</span> it to render it fine &amp;
purged of gravel, which would prevent it from casting neatly. The <m>dung</m>
renders the <m>earth</m> more amenable &amp; easier to deal with, but it
is necessary that it be well free of <m>straw</m> &amp; other things.
And when the <m>earth</m> is very fat, one needs to give it more sand
&amp; more <m>dung</m>. But one does find fat varieties of <m>earth</m>,
themselves mixed with sand. If they are not, make them so artificially.
One always needs to reheat the <m>earths</m> before casting.</div></div><div id="p041r_02"><h2><span>Garden lilly</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">If one breaks it at its first blossom &amp; it will bud &amp; bloom
only <span><span>in the following year</span></span>, &amp; know the
<span>bulbous plants</span> do thus.</div></div><div id="p041r_03"><h2>Sand</h2><div data-layout="middle">The sand chosen <s>cast</s> for casting should be neither so
lean that it has no stickiness, nor too fat. And even if it is found
<span><m>in nature</m></span>, however, it is not everywhere. And if you
are in a place where it is not found, you can make it, but not with
<m>fat earth</m>, for the sand does not want any of that, for it makes
it very porous. But you can make it bindable with <m>brick well
ground</m> on <span><m>marble</m></span>, or <m>plaster</m> or <m>calcinated
alabaster</m> or something similar, or the <m>burned marrow of
<span>ox</span> horn</m> or <m>burned asphalt</m>. If you grind it quite
finely on <span><m>porphyry</m></span>, it <s><span>s</span></s> acquires
stickiness better &amp; then you can burn it with <m>asphalt</m> or mix
it with a <span>quarter part</span> of <m>tripoli</m>. Guard against
<m>bread</m> falling into your sand because it makes it very
porous.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

after they are hatched, but remain in this state. But after that they grow quickly, similarly if they go into the water. One feeds them with <m>boiled
<span><span>millet</span></span> grains</m>, crumbling them among <m>bread</m>
and spreading in <m>well chopped <span>lettuces</span></m>.</div></div></folio></body></html>
