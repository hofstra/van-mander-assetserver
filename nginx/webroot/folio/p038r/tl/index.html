treille</span>,</span> because they are pierced and it is said that a
certain <span>king</span> had made from these a certain ornament in the
shape of a trellis, that would be thus named the
Screen of <span>Charlemagne</span> in the
treasure of <span>Saint Denis</span>, in which the <m>gemstones</m> are
mounted without leaf, so as to have the enjoyment of the light on one
side &amp; the other, &amp;to show their naivete. I have a white one
that seems to be rough &amp; pierced, and is spotted all over with blue
blemishes. I am of the opinion that these are artificial &amp; that they
are of <m><span>taffre</span></m> or <m>very clear <span>esmail azuré</span></m>
melted entirely on the <m>sapphire</m>. <add>The <span>file</span> bites it
as on the <m>beryl</m>.</add></div></div><div id="p038r_2"><h2><m><span>Saffron</span></m></h2><div data-layout="middle">It is counterfeited &amp; augmented with <m><span>marigold</span> leaves
half-dried, &amp; twisted like a thread</m>, &amp; put <span>in the
hottest sun</span> to dry, &amp; is mixed, &amp; the aforesaid
<span>marigold</span> even gives some color.</div></div><div id="p038r_3"><h2><m>Sapphire</m></h2><div data-layout="middle"><span>Stone cutters</span> sometimes choose old pieces of <m>antique
glass</m> in <span>church</span> windows, which are much thicker than
those of <span>today</span> &amp; are of more lively colors. If it is for
<s><span>souf</span></s> <m>sapphire</m>, they choose beautiful blue
&amp; from such a place that there are no <s>pieces</s>
<add>grains</add>, if it is possible. And having cut it in squares with
<m>emery</m>, they cut it in bevel &amp; polish it. And in this manner,
    they counterfeit very beautiful <m>sapphires</m>. The old <m><span>esmail
d’azur</span></m> for <m>silver</m> verging on aquamarine was very
appropriate for counterfeiting <m>sapphires</m>, but it is scarcely
found. One counterfeits <m>aquamarines</m> with <m>white glass</m>, but
they take it from the bottom of the <m>glass</m>.</div></div><div id="p038r_4"><h2><m>Amber</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">The orangeish color that is in <m>transparent amber</m> and in the
other one that has body is not internal, for on the inside it is
whitish. But through age <s>it</s> or wearing it, it acquires this
reddish crust. This is why those who cut it with the <span>file</span> or on
the <span>wheel</span> do not remove, if it is possible, this crust. But
they only polish it, rubbing it with a <span><m><span>willow</span></m>
stick</span> or other <m>soft wood</m> dipped into <m>water</m> &amp;
dusted with <m>tripoli of <span>Brittany</span></m> , and it takes a
beautiful polish. If it is too straw yellow &amp; you want to intensify
its color, hang it inside a <span>chimney</span> where there is much
<m>soot</m> &amp; <m>smoke</m>, and it will take on a reddish-orange
color. Try to take the most whitish transparent one, and put it under
<m>dung</m> to turn it green, like <m>bones</m>. Or <m>smoke</m> it
<span>in a closed space</span>, in the <m>smoke of <span>safre</span></m> or
<m>manganese</m> &amp; other <m>drugs</m> that you know. Or in
<m><span>urine</span></m> &amp; <m>distilled vinegar</m> mixed with colors, or in the
<m>vapor of <span>aquafortis</span></m> boiling in <m>copper</m>, or
<m><span>aquafortis</span></m> boiling with <m>silver</m> &amp; <m><span>sal
ammoniac</span></m> &amp; Some cut <m>amber</m> in facets on a <span>wheel
of <m>soft wood</m></span> with <m><span>potée</span></m> instead of
<m>emery</m>, &amp; <m>jet</m> also. The <m>salt called <span><span>de
Langlois de armonic</span></span></m> is a <m>mineral salt</m> that
resembles <m>marble stone</m> and is a very hard mineral with large
pieces, like that of <span>Cardona</span> &amp; <span>Monserrat</span>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



I have experimented by making it boil in <m>lye</m> or <m>corrosive
water</m>, it turns reddish on the surface. And if it is rubbed against
<m><span>fir</span></m> &amp; <m>soft wood</m> before it is cooled, it is
easily cut.</div></div></folio></body></html>
