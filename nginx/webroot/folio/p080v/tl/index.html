<m>tin</m></add></span></h2><div data-layout="middle">They usually cast with <m>solder</m>, even the things that should
not come out empty, for the latter require <m>fine &amp; soft tin</m>,
which however would not release, &amp; would not come out empty if it
was mixed or had some <m>looking glass tin</m> <s>mix</s>
<add>in</add> it, just like they put in a little of it in <m>soft
tin</m>. They engrave their works on <m>stones of which are made the
sharpening stones or files of <span>barbers</span></m>, which are found in
<span>great flakes towards the mountains</span>, &amp; resemble
<m>slate</m>. They are three colors of them: reddish, which is not as
perfect as the others because it does not last as long in the fire
<s>&amp; as</s>,one <s><span>dard</span></s> of the color of dark
<m>slate</m>, the other whitish. When they have some relief, first they
imprint it on <span><m><span>carton</span></m></span>, as thick as one
<span><span>finger</span></span>, <add>to serve as a pattern</add>, then with a
little <span>compass</span> &amp; little matching <m>iron fittings</m>, they
engrave their figures, having first flattened their <m>stones</m> &amp;
worn down one against the other, they make their <s><span>p</span></s>
molds of three or four pieces, to make a circle or a square which joins
perfectly, because the <m>stones</m> render themselves even. Before
casting, they rub the mold with <m>tallow</m>, which has quickly
absorbed it because it is hot. Then, taking <m>fine powder of
quicklime</m> in a <span><m>linen</m></span>, they rub the mold while
beating with the <span><m>linen</m></span> on top, then blow a little on top
to prevent it from becoming porous. The main thing is to make vents, if
the work is a little large. They make them in this manner, as you see
represented here. They pierce a hole in some place on the medal that is
least visible. And then with a <span>borer</span> they pierce the mold on
the side of the medal.

And if they want their work to stay pierced in any place, they drive in
<span>a piece of <m>cork</m></span> at this place in the <span>mold</span>. And
the <m>lead</m> or <m>tin</m> will not attach to it. </div><div data-layout="left-top">
