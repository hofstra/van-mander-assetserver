distemper on the <m>plaster</m> portrait, always leaving each layer to
dry. Next, with <m>mine d’<span>Angleterre</span></m> ground on a marble, or
burnt <m>lead</m>, grind <s>av</s> &amp; distemper with a bit of
<m>gum</m> or <s><span>go</span></s> <m>glue</m>, lay down lightly. Once
dry, rub lightly with a little <m>cotton</m> and the <m>plaster</m>
portrait will seem to be of <m>lead</m>. Others grind <m>minium</m> with
<m>quicksilver</m>.</div></div><div id="p043r_3"><h2><m>Purpurine</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">The soft <m>tin</m>, <span>half an ounce</span> of, melt it in a

of <m>sal ammoniac</m>, an <span>℥</span> of <m>sulfur</m>, the yellowest
that may be found, grind both of them. And then mix very well all the
aforementioned materials. Next put all together into a <s><span>a

a small fire for an <span><span>hour</span></span> &amp; for an
<span><span>hour</span></span> over a stronger one &amp; for an
<span><span>hour</span></span> over a very strong fire, and it will be done.
Next, to use it, apply <m>soot black</m> with the <m>glue</m> that
<span>painters</span> use to paint, <s>&amp;</s> two or three times,
until it is quite black. Next apply a little <m>varnish</m>. Once dry,
apply the <m>purpurine</m> a secco with a <span><span>finger</span></span> where
you want. The more you apply, the more beautiful it will be. Next, if
you want, apply <m>varnish</m> on top.</div></div><div id="p043r_4"><h2>White bronzing</h2><div data-layout="middle">Apply black with <m>glue</m>, as was said, on the medal, then
