is in order that the <m>thread</m> holds better on it. These are made of
cords like the <m>silk</m> ones &amp; between two cords one sets one or
two <m>threads</m> to make it show up better. The <m>silver</m> kind is
made similarly, and there is not as much trouble as with <m>silk</m>,
and even less because it takes more to twist <m>silk</m>, because one
needs to twist it twice. A grip of <m>fine gold</m> is worth 18 or 20
