<ab>The <m>gold</m> grips are made by putting underneath <m>thin yellow
canvas</m> or a different <m>canvas yellowed with chalk</m>. And this
<m>canvas</m> is set with <m>glue</m> or the aforesaid <m>gum</m>, this
is in order that the <m>thread</m> holds better on it. These are made of
cords like the <m>silk</m> ones &amp; between two cords one sets one or
two <m>threads</m> to make it show up better. The <m>silver</m> kind is
made similarly, and there is not as much trouble as with <m>silk</m>,
and even less because it takes more to twist <m>silk</m>, because one
needs to twist it twice. A grip of <m>fine gold</m> is worth 18 or 20
<ms><cn><fr>sols</fr></cn></ms>.</ab>

<ab>The best sword point is the <m><pa>sage</pa> leaf</m> form.</ab>

<ab>This long plank on which the sword is attached &amp; laid down to
furbish it is called the
<tl><df><fr>chameau</fr></df></tl><comment>c_094v_04</comment>, it is
commonly of <m><pa>rowan</pa></m><comment>c_094v_05</comment> which is
hard &amp; even.</ab>

<ab>The lower stick which is folded like a bow is called the
<tl><df><fr>arson</fr></df></tl>.</ab>

<ab>The upper is called the <tl><df>stick of the
<fr>fustée</fr></df></tl>.</ab>

<ab>And this small square piece, which is pu<del><ill/></del>t
<del><fr>l</fr></del>on the sword to burnish it, is called the
<tl><df><fr>fustée</fr></df></tl>.</ab>

<ab>There are two horns: one is called the <df><m>oil</m> horn</df> and
the other the <df><m>emery</m> horn</df><comment>c_094v_06</comment>.
</ab>

<ab>There is an <m>iron</m> which is made like a <tl>halberd point</tl>,
square, &amp; of <m>very even steel, &amp; well <tl>filed</tl></m>,
which is called the
<tl><df><fr>grateau</fr></df></tl><comment>c_094v_07</comment> which
serves to <corr><del>to</del></corr> soften the traces of the
<tl>file</tl> on sword guards &amp; to give an edge to swords after they
have been milled, which is better than with a <tl><m>stone</m></tl> or a
<tl><m><fr>coux</fr></m></tl>, which quite often makes scratches.</ab>

<ab>To make <del><fr>coupp</fr></del> swords cut better, one gives them
the edge by pulling upwards from the point.</ab>

<ab><pro>Those who create sword guards</pro> are <pro>artisans</pro>
separate from the <pro>furbisher</pro>.</ab>

<ab>The <tl><df><fr>fustée</fr></df></tl> is a square piece of wood
three <ms><bp>fingers</bp> in thickness</ms>, of
<m><pa>boxwood</pa></m>, which is fitted in the middle of the stick
<add>of the <tl>fustée</tl> to furbish</add>.</ab>

<ab>The <tl><m><fr>fresil</fr></m> stick</tl> is of <m><pa>willow</pa>
wood</m> which is to clean the rust off weapons with
<df><m><fr>fresil</fr></m></df> which is the <m>iron scale</m> falling
at the <tl><pro>farriers</pro>' forge</tl>.</ab>
