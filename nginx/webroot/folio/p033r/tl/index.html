middle in such a way that it easily moves to one side &amp; the other
&amp; the side <s><span></span></s> A, is hidden inside its <span>handle</span>
marked C as readily as the side B. The two tenons you see at the tip of
the <span>knife</span> are for locking it on one side or the other against a
<span>nail</span> which is at the butt of the aforesaid <span>handle</span>, in order 
that, when one wants to press hard <add>on</add> something to
cut it, it does not come out from the <span>handle</span>. You may allow the
side marked B to cut for demonstration purposes, <add>but not
much</add>, but the side that is notched <s>A</s> and marked A must
not cut. <s>It</s> It is sufficient that it be furbished well. And
also the notch needs to be as thick as <span>the back of a
<span>knife</span></span> in order that it cannot cause <span>pain</span>. And you
will only show the part of the <span>knife</span> which is not notched, for
the side with the notch needs to be <s><span>mar</span></s> hidden
inside the <span>handle</span>. And when you want to cut the <span>nose</span>
or a <span>finger</span>, pretend to sharpen your <span>knife</span> on the
<span>thigh</span> and, while <s>while</s> doing this, turn the
<span>knife</span> deftly. &amp; the part with the notch, which you will
cover <s><span>l</span></s> with one <span>finger</span>, will come into
your <span>hand</span>, and you will place the notch, colored with
<m>brazilwood rosette</m> or <m><span>black cherry</span> juice</m>, upon
the <span>nose</span>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



The <span>conjuror</span> ought not to amuse himself by watching what he
is doing, but look at the <span>spectators</span> and give them plenty of
good hocus-pocus words so that they look at his <span>face</span> &amp; not
at his <span>hands</span>.</div></div><div id="p033r_2"><div id="fig_p033r_3" data-layout="middle"><img alt="" classname="inline-figure" src="/bnf-ms-fr-640/figures/p033r_3.png"></div><h2>For relighting an extinguished <span>candle</span> between your
