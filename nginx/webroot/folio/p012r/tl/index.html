<m>pulverized sanguine</m>, which renders it harder and stronger. Having
let it melt well until it becomes liquid, like <m>oil</m>, mix it with
<m>verdigris</m>, and you <s><span>m</span></s> will cast in
<m>plaster</m> very neat a <span>lizard</span>, or something else.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



You must not cast that which has not become well cooled &amp; that which
has not lost all its pustules &amp; bubbles, and has not settled down
well &amp; become smooth like <s><span></span></s> <m>water</m>. The
<m>soot black</m> gives it a fine luster &amp; makes it neater. The most
beautiful yellow <m>sulfur</m> must be used, for the greyish &amp;
lively <m>sulfur</m> is not good. Do not cast <span>in wind</span> &amp;
<span>cold</span>, for it would become porous.</div></div><div id="p012r_2"><h2><m><span>Chimolee</span></m></h2><div data-layout="middle">The <m><def><span>terre chimolee</span></def></m>, otherwise known as
<m><span>fuller</span>â€™s earth</m>, with which they dress the
<m>cloth</m>, is excellent for molding hollow or in relief; &amp; if you
want to reheat it, it must first be warmed, &amp; reheat it gently on a
low, indirect fire, &amp; little by little, otherwise it would crack.
Put the figure to reheat in a <span>pot</span> in an <span>oven</span>, or in a
<span>covered oven</span>. It is very malleable, clean &amp; fine. <add>You
can make a cavity for animals of <m><span>chimolee</span></m> &amp; cast
<m>lead</m> in it.</add></div><div data-layout="left-middle">



The work needs to be dried for 4 or 5 <span>days</span> before you reheat
it. When you mold &amp; make a cavity from <m><span>chimolee</span></m>, do
not press too hard, but softly, for it would crack.</div></div><div id="p012r_3"><h2><m>Paper</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">The whitest &amp; finest is the best. And when the cavity is quite
clean, as of <m>sulfur</m> or <m>baked <span>chimolee</span></m>, it is made
very neatly. You can give it one or two layers of <m>white</m> with a
border of <m>gold</m> to imitate <m>alabaster</m>. And after you have
applied the <m>white</m>, you can burnish it with the <span>tooth</span>.
But in order for it to be burnished, one needs to mix the <m>lead
white</m> with <m>glair of egg</m> &amp; <m>peelings from the <span>fig
tree</span></m>. Or better, varnish your work with <m>white varnish</m>.
In addition when you are molding with <m>paper</m>, as it starts to dry,
burnish from the back with the <span>tooth</span>.</div></div><div id="p012r_4"><h2><m>Plaster</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">That from the <span>mountains</span> is greyer, and <s>the</s> the
one from the region of <span>Albi</span> is whiter. It must be cooked with a
closed fire, such as a <span>reverberatory furnace</span> or <span><span>fours
de barbiers</span></span>. And the most freshly cooked is the best. It must
be finely ground on <span><m>marble</m></span>. After having prepared your
cavity from <m>sulfur</m> or something else, &amp; <m>oiling</m> it,
&amp; having enclosed it in a <corr>circle</corr>, temper not too
thickly your <m>plaster</m> with <m>water</m>, &amp; separate it well
with your <span><span>finger</span></span>, and if it makes pustules, throw in
more <m>powder of the said plaster</m> &amp; <s><span></span></s> grind it
with the <span><span>finger</span></span> until <mark>+</mark></div><div data-layout="left-middle">



<mark>+</mark> it makes no more pustules. Then cast &amp; sprinkle
once again with <m>plaster powder</m> &amp; leave to set well, then
scrape off the powder.</div></div></folio></body></html>
