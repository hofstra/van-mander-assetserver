awkward to burn &amp; clean, one needs to uncover as much as one can,
especially the little legs until the end, for these are awkward &amp; if
they were not to be uncovered and you were to have to pull them, you
could break something in the <span>mold</span>. While uncovering with the
<span>point of a knife</span>, or even a <span>burin</span> or other <span>clean
thing</span>, clean very carefully the sand which will be in the joints
&amp; elsewhere with your <span>little brushes</span>. And if something gets
detached, attach it with <m>wax</m>, as said. And attach also the horns
in the same way. And make also the gate, along the end of the little
legs, with some <span>wax</span>. And fill the holes made by the <span><m>iron
wire</m> point</span> with it. And once everything is well neat &amp; more
than half is uncovered, <m>oil</m> your <s><span>ut</span></s> <span>mold</span>
<s>&amp; <span>nâ€™oubli</span></s>, after having dipped the reverse in
<m>water</m> &amp; do not forget to <m>oil</m> all the delicate parts
which are between the legs and the little pincers. Then, rub the
<span>crayfish</span> with <m>eau-de-vie</m>. And make your second cast,
having flattened the first <span>mold</span>, in order that the
<span>clamps</span> join better. Your <span>mold</span> must be wider on the
side that is imprinted, than the back. Do not open your <span>mold</span>
after the second cast unless it has been <m>luted</m> &amp; reheated
&amp; that what is inside is burned. Do not forget to put
<m><span>crocum</span></m> among your sand when you mold <span>crayfish</span>,
for one needs to reheat strongly &amp; the <m><span>crocum</span></m>
withstands marvelously. Molding a <span>crab</span> &amp; a
<span>crayfish</span> is all the <add>same</add>. When you have uncovered
your <span>crayfish</span> on one side, delay the least that you can for
making the second cast, for <s><span>el</span></s> <span>crayfish</span> dry
<s><span>se</span></s> out. It is not just about uncovering the
<span>crayfish</span> well, in such a way that you see an entire half, but
take heed that your <span>mold</span> itself, in which you uncover, release
well, for even if the <span>crayfish</span> were well burned, you
<s><span>despoui</span></s> would not be able to open your <span>mold</span>
without breaking.</div><div data-layout="top" data-layout-hint="wide">Repair with

the others, or raised above, or folded on its own, give it a gate of
