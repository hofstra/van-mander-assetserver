<span>birds</span> taken from the nest &amp; which have not had freedom are
better, for these which are taken by net never sing so well. However,
the savage ones give <s><span></span></s> much pleasure with their
chanting, but they ought be taken <span><span>before Michaelmas</span></span>,
otherwise they scarcely live. A small impostume occurs on all on the
fork of their tail, occasionally, which some call <span><span>gaillardise</span></span>,
which makes them sick &amp; sometimes makes them die, especially
<span>calandra larks</span>. One knows when they are sad &amp; do not sing.
One must pierce it <s><span>av</span></s>, not with a <span>pin</span>, but
very gently by turning with the tip of <span>quite pointy feather</span>.
The <span>calandra lark</span> does not want to be without <s>grey</s>
river sand, &amp; the grey is the best, a little coarse. It rubs itself in it
&amp; is purged by it.

<span>pin</span> or <span>needle</span>, folded on all four sides. Hold it with
the end of a small <span>cleft stick</span> and, holding the said
<span>stick</span> by the<s><span>un bout</span></s> <add>other</add> end,
put your <span>card</span> three or 4 <span><span>fingers</span></span> away from
the <m>water</m> that you will have put in a <span>dish</span> or similar
<span>vessel</span>. Then pour your <m>lead</m>, which should not be too
hot, into the <span>card</span> &amp; continually tap on the <span>stick</span>
that holds it. And thus your <m>lead</m> will turn into round grains.
And pass it through a coarse <span>sieve</span> to separate the largest grain
from the smallest. The largeish one will reach 25 to 30 <span>paces</span>.

are fed oats <span>all summer</span> in order that they are fed without
fattening, to be more appropriate for hunting &amp; taking the others.
Then, when one wants to fatten them for selling, one gives them
<span><span>millet</span></span>. They sing <span>at night</span>. One needs to
<s><span>c</span></s> take them <span><span>after mid-July until
Michaelmas</span></span>, for after that time that they have their young in
this country, they go like the <span>turtledoves</span>. <span>Siskins</span>
should also be taken <span><span>from All Saints' Day until
Christmas</span></span>, for after that they go to the <span>mountains</span> to
brood.
