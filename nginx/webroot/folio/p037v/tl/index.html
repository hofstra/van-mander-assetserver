For sowing <span>melons</span> well, one needs it to be the <span>end of a
moon cycle</span> for otherwise they would bud too many leaves &amp;
not bear enough fruit. Make small <s><span>e</span></s> holes, <span>two
<span>fingers</span> by two <span>fingers</span></span>, with a <span>pickaxe</span>
&amp; put in each two or three <m>seeds</m>. Next, take <m>very fine
earth</m> &amp; fill the depressions lightly with it. Next, spread over
all to the <span>thickness of a <span>thumb</span></span> <span>havets</span>, that
is to say <span>wheat</span> <s><span>fl</span></s> chaff, in order that the
coming rain does not beat the earth &amp; prevent their birth.
<add><span>Havets</span> attract <span>field mice</span> who eat the seeds. And
for avoiding this, one must moisten them with <s><span>s</span></s> a
<m>decoction of <span>wormwood</span></m>.</add>

Some do not saturate the <m>glass</m> with <m><span>gris
d'escaille</span></m> for working as primer, but trace on the <m>clean
glass</m> with <m>noir à huile</m>. But it is very necessary that the
<m>wood</m> be rid of <m>grease</m>, because if it has even a bit of
<m>grease</m>, the color will not take on it at all. And further, if the
<span>glassworker</span> who is working has a <span>stench</span> from his
<span>nose</span> or his <span>mouth</span> <s><span>la</span></s>, &amp; he
<span>breathes</span> on the <m>glass</m>, the color will not take on it.
Those who discovered the invention of working in small works of supple
<m>enamels</m> use only <m><span>esmail d'azur</span></m>, which is blue,
&amp; <m><span>esmail colombin</span></m>, which is the color of purple,
which they make supple with <m>rock pieces</m> or <m>leaded glass</m>.
As for the yellow, they make it from <m>silver</m>, the red from
<m>sanguine</m>, as is said elsewhere, the black &amp; gray &amp;
shadows with the <m><span>noir d'escaille</span></m>, either strong or weak,
the carnation with the <m>light sanguine</m>. The green is made first
from yellow, then on top they coat <m><span>esmail d'azur</span></m>, either
strong or weak, according to whether they want to make it bright or
dark.

It is cut with a <span>file</span>, then one passes a certain <m>pulverized
salt</m> across the surface, which an <span>Englishman</span> called
<span><span>desramonet</span></span>. But I believe that this was <m>pulverized
pumice stone</m>, for it had the harshness of <m>arène</m>. And with a
taut <span>cord</span>, he polished his <m>amber</m>, then passed
<span><m>tripoli from <span>Bretagne</span></m></span> on it with the
<span><span>finger</span></span>; others used a piece of <span><m>leather</m></span>
or a <span>cane</span>. <m>Amber</m> loses its color if an unhealthy person
wears it, &amp; becomes whitish. But to restore it, it needs to be
soaked for one <span><span>night</span></span> in <m><span>urine</span></m>, then boiled a
little in it.
