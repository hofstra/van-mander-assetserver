&amp; turned in various fashions, it does not appear beautiful if it is not
painted, &amp; also, equally, if it has weight <s><span>ou
for</span></s> that the stem of <m>tin</m>, which is brittle &amp;
delicate, would be unable to support. One molds the flower of the
<span>rose</span> on its own &amp;separately, making its gate largeish in order
that it comes out <s><span>b</span></s> better. Then one cuts this gate
down closest to the stem of the bud, on which one grafts next &amp;
<m>solders</m> a <span>stalk of <m>latten wire</m></span> to which one also
<m>solders</m> the leaves. But because <m>tin</m>, being thus thin, is
troublesome to <m>solder</m>, and any leaf can be melted. And also
because the cast flowers &amp; especially the <span>rose</span> are not
beautiful without being painted, one does not take pains to
<m>solder</m>, but one <s>it</s> grafts the pieces to join them
&amp; one <m>glues</m> them with <m><span>fish</span> glue</m> that has been
a little wetted &amp; thickly melted. And in order that it imprints
better, one heats the <m>tin</m> work gently &amp; at a distance, for
when cold, the <m>glue</m> would not take. After your flower is thus
repaired, you follow the joints of the added parts with <m>modelling
wax</m> <s><span>esb</span></s>, which is a <m>white wax</m> mixed with
much <m><add>well-ground</add> ceruse</m>, or even better, <m>lead
white</m>, melting it &amp; applying it on your work with a <span>small
hot point of <m>iron</m></span>. In this way you can repair these little
flashings that are in the middle of the <span>rose</span>, or the holes
<s>of the</s> that may be in any petal. Next, you will paint your
<span>rose</span> according to nature. If you cast your <span>rose</span> in
<m>gold</m> or <m>silver</m>, you can join &amp; <m>solder</m> well. And
in these same <m>metals</m>, when you have something delicate to join to
the flower, like a <span>fly</span> or something similar, <m><span>fish</span>
glue</m> is remarkable for it &amp; holds very well, fixing it with a
few <span>small points</span> which serve as <span>nails</span>. The leaves
&amp; buds can be molded in two <span>molds</span> that can be opened once
reheated, but not before. Next, these said things are joined.</div></div></folio></body></html>
