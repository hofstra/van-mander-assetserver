receiving <span>cherries</span> and <span>plums</span> or whatever fruit that
you want. Put in some <m>hot water</m><span>for the space of two
hours</span>. And when your <m>water</m> will be cooled, throw it &amp;
turn the opening upside down on a <span>quite even <s>&amp;</s>
table</span>, &amp; <span>in a room where there is not a bit of air &amp;
of wind</span>. Then <s><span>en</span></s> prepare a stopper of <m>new
wax</m>, wrapped in <m>waxed canvas</m>, and adjust it to the
<span>ampul</span> quite precisely in order that it will be all ready to
stop it when you will have put in the fruit. And when you will have
delicately picked with your <span>hand</span> only the <m>fruit</m> that is
not rotten &amp; <span>on a warm &amp; dry day</span>, return to the
<span>well-closed room, where neither wind nor draft may enter</span>,
&amp; put it gently &amp; with dexterity in the <span>bottle</span>. Then
stop the <span>bottle</span> well with the <span>stopper</span> &amp; lute it
&amp; making the lute if it seems good with some <m>quicklime</m> &amp;
<m>oil</m>, &amp; such that no <m>water</m> may enter in. Then put your
<span>bottles</span> in a <span>vat full of <m>water</m></span>, <span>during the
summer</span> <s><span>Et lhiver pourceque la cave s</span></s>, <span>in
a cellar</span>, and <span>in the winter</span> put your <span>bottles</span>
into a <span>basket</span> furnished with some <span>weights</span> &amp; lower
it to the bottom of a <span>deep well</span>. For <span>in the winter</span>
the <m>water of the vat</m> would be too cold if the <span>cellar</span>
is not quite warm, for one needs the <m>water</m> to be like <m>river
water</m>.</div></div><div id="p050r_2"><h2>Molding</h2><div data-layout="middle">If you want to promptly mold something in <span>demy relief</span> that
comes to hand, fold some <span><m>paper</m></span> in five or six doubles,
&amp; place it on the <span>medal</span> &amp; make sure the
<span><m>paper</m></span> is folded on the back of the <span>medal</span> so
that it is well secured. Next, take a <span>stick</span>, broad at one end
&amp; pointed at the other, well softened and rub well on the
<span><m>paper</m></span>, &amp;with the point of the <span>stick</span> retrace
the lines &amp; proceed until you recognize that your imprint is well
done. Then, at your convenience, slightly rub <m>oil</m> with a
<span><span>pinceau</span></span> <s><span>lemp</span></s> on the
<span><m>&gt;paper</m></span> imprint and cast in <m>tallow</m> or
<m>wax</m> or <m>sulphur</m>, &amp; the <span><m>paper</m></span>, without
it burning, will render your portrait neat, which you will afterwards be able to
mold in <m>plaster</m> or <m>tripoli</m>, and then in
<m>lead</m> &amp; other <m>metal</m>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



Polished <span><m><span>carton</span></m></span> of little thickness &amp; a little
moistened is proper. Then if you want, strengthen it with
