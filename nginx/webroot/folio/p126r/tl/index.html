when dry</add>, and with it, one casts well round things &amp; large
muscles, but awkwardly things fine &amp; delicate. However, try <m>well
clarified sugar</m>. One needs to soak for one <span><span>night</span></span>
or one <span><span>day</span></span> the <span><m>plaster</m> mold</span> before
casting the <m>sugar</m>, in order that is very full of <m>water</m>
&amp; does not imbibe the <m>syrup</m>. One needs also for it to be of
easy release, for the <m>sugar</m> is sour &amp; brittle. Finally, do
not consider casting anything in <m>sugar</m> that does not release well
and that cannot be neatly molded in two halves, to open it when you will
need to. If you want to mold a bunch of <span>grapes</span>, one needs to
take it, like any other fruit, in its true vigor, for if it is withered,
it will <s><span>ne</span></s> come out that way. Take heed, therefore,
to make your <span>molds</span> in the natural <span>season</span> of
<s><span>que</span></s> all things. The <span>grapes</span>, that are
usually wanted cast in <m>sugar</m>, can be made artificially or with
<m>wax</m> or <m>earth</m>, or even with some <span>grapes</span> attached
with some melted <m>wax</m> on some <span>slab</span> &amp; other full
thing, so that they are very close together and when released &amp; only
make up one half. Or, if you have some of those <span>grapes</span> called
<span>chauches</span> or <span>sauvignons</span>, which have the <span>grapes</span>
very close together, encase half of them <s>on</s> in the
<span><m>clay</m> slab</span> and cast on the other half. And if some of the
<span>grapes</span> are not released, pluck them out. Note that neither in
<m>sugar</m>, nor in <m>metal</m>, can a bunch which has light &amp;
separated <span>grapes</span> be cast properly, because the end of the bunch
is so delicate, especially if you keep the bunch, that it could not
withstand the large <span>grapes</span>. Thus, you will need to cast
hollow, which you could not do if the bunch does not have close
<span>grapes</span> &amp; <s><span>molds</span></s> without having them
scattered &amp; spread apart.</div><div data-layout="left-top">



To cast <span>pears</span> &amp; <span>apples</span> in <m>sugar</m>, one ought
not make any gates, but rather, fill one half of the <span>mold</span> and
then join the two, and keep turning it until the <m>sugar</m> has set
and is cold. One ought to mix nothing in the <span>mold</span> apart from
<m>plaster</m>, reheated as you know.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

One needs for the <span>mold</span> to have soaked <span>one <span>day</span>
and one <span>night</span></span> in <m>cold water</m> <s>for</s>, and
to be humid, when you cast in <m>sugar</m>.</div><div data-layout="left-bottom">



The sign that the <m>syrup</m> or the <m>sugar melted in water</m> is sufficiently
cooked to cast fruits, is when it makes threads when shaken. And
if it passes that point, it is not good, for it will always be humid. If
the <m>sugar</m> attaches to it, one needs to throw some
<m><span>wheat</span> starch</m> in the <span>mold</span>, or to rub it with an
<span><m><span>almond</span></m></span>.</div></div></folio></body></html>
