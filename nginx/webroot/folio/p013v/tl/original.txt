<head>For knowing the good <m>azurite ash</m> for <m>oil</m></head>

<ab>The one that piles up in small <corr>clods</corr> and is lumpy is
the best because it is the most subtle. Also the one that is also very
pale in color, because <m>oil</m> darkens it. Certain
<pro>sophisticators</pro> mix them, but you will know this if you pour
some onto a piece of <m>paper</m> &amp; lay it flat &amp; smudge it with
the <tl><bp>finger</bp></tl> since, if it is mixed, it will be found
variegated &amp; as if with pale &amp; darker stripes, but if it is
unmixed it will be even &amp; of one color.

<ab>The kind which comes from the head of the <al>toad</al> &amp; has
the shape of the <al>toad</al>, painted nature-like as you have seen, is
the most excellent. It is held that if one puts the powder of it on a
<tl>brazier</tl> in chamber of some persons <tmp>at night</tmp>, they
will be neither able to move, nor speak, nor thwart <pro>thieves</pro>.

<ab>It is said that if one calls a <al>snake</al> in Greek, saying
<gk>ΟΦΗ ΟΦΗ</gk>, it will flee. Likewise, if one <del><fr>nom</fr></del>
