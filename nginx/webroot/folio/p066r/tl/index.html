make one layer &amp; finish at the first go. But the colors soon die.
And when they are layered twice, they do not die. One needs to layer
them lightly &amp; not very thick, to soften them well.</div></div><div id="p066r_2"><h2>Shadows</h2><div data-layout="middle">For women, <m>asphaltum</m>, <m>umber</m> &amp; a little

<m>wood</m>, and because one is at great pains to make a good
<s>a</s> face on it, some thin their colors with <m>glair of egg</m>
passed through a <span>sponge</span>, or mixed with the <m>yolk</m>,
<m>water</m>, &amp; thoroughly beaten with the <m>peelings of the <span>fig
tree</span></m>. With this | they paint &amp; soften on the <m>wood</m>,
as with <m>oil</m>, and this supports the <m>varnish</m>, but this does
not last.</div></div><div id="p066r_4"><h2>Colors in <m>oil</m> that are imbibed</h2><div data-layout="middle">It is best that colors in <m>oil</m> are imbibed, that is to say
they do not remain shiny after they are dry, for they do not die. But if
in some places they are shiny, it is that the fattiness of the
<m>oil</m> has remained in that part which would make the colors die.
The <m>varnish</m> mends all this &amp; unites &amp; renders it similar
in one place as in another.</div><div data-layout="middle">One needs gold color to be laid down thick, for if it is clear, it
would be imbibed &amp; would run.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

in which they clean their <span><span>pinceaulx</span> for <m>oil</m></span>,
because the three aforesaid colors are gripping &amp; dry immediately.
Next they lay down the <m>gold</m>, then varnish on top of all. And it
seems to some by this means that all this black is painted in
<m>oil</m>, but it would not be good because the <m>gold</m> would

It is made with <m>massicot</m>, <m>minium</m>, <m><span>ochre de

resembles <m>gold</m>. Gild <span>the day after</span> <s><span>un

ground for the color in the <span>evening</span>. After having gilded,
let it dry &amp; rest one <span><span>day</span></span>, next rub the gilding
with a <span>feather</span> &amp; <span><m><span>cotton</span></m></span> in order
that no burrs remain, then varnish with <m><span>Flanders</span>
varnish</m>, which you make mixed with a little <m>eau-de-vie</m>, to render it desiccative.</div><div data-layout="middle">The <m>varnish</m> will be dry in an <span><span>hour</span></span>. It
will increase the color of gold. And this <m><span>or mat</span></m> holds
<span>in the rain</span>, even if one rubs it. But it must be well dried
for eight or ten <span><span>days</span></span>.</div><div data-layout="middle">Gold color that is made of different colors cleaned from
<span><span>pinceaulx</span> for <m>oil</m></span> is not so good, &amp; with

must not touch with a <span>finger</span> the layer made <corr>for</corr>
the gold because that will keep it from attaching itself. The <m><span>or

mat</span></m> holds well <span>in the rain</span> &amp; in <m>water</m>.
One must not burnish it, because the <span>tooth</span> would remove it.
Gather the burrs &amp; small flakes that the
