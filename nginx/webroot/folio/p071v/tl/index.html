4 <span>℥</span> of <m>sandarac</m> &amp; <m>mastic,
pulverized subtly</m> . And first, boil your <m>oil</m> in a
<span>pot</span> on a <span>chafing dish</span>, and then mix in little <add>by
little</add> the aforesaid <m>gums</m>, stirring continually with a
<span>small stick split and quartered at the tip</span>, &amp; when you do
not collect <m>gum</m> with the tip, that is to say that it is totally
melted &amp; that your <m>varnish</m> is done. And to render it clearer,
put into the concoction a little lump of <m>camphor</m>. It is true that
with this it is not dry so soon. Heed well that the <m><span>spike
lavender</span> oil</m> will be good, clear &amp; not fatty, otherwise
your <m>varnish</m> will be worth nothing. You can test it
<s><span>d</span></s> by soaking some <m>paper</m> in it &amp; heating
it. If the <m>oil</m>, which will evaporate, leaves the <m>paper</m>
clean, without <s>being</s> a yellow mark, it is good, if not, it is
fatty.</div></div><div id="p071v_2"><h2><span>Sheep</span> fat</h2><div data-layout="middle">In a certain region of <span>England</span>, the <span>sheep</span> that
graze there have very yellow fat and are nevertheless just as good as
others.</div></div><div id="p071v_3"><h2><span>Spider</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">In <span>Ireland</span>, one finds none there, &amp; if one touches them
with <span><m>wood</m></span> that is there, they die. This is why some of
the <span>rich</span> from <span>England</span> make their ceilings from this
<m>wood</m>, &amp; by this method, they never have cobwebs
&amp; spiderwebs.</div></div><div id="p071v_4"><h2>Sand</h2><div data-layout="middle">The <m><span>cimolée</span></m> is very good for casting in
<m>copper</m>, but one ought not take <m>the one from
<span>cutlers</span></m>, because it is only <m>sludge</m>, but rather the
one of those who <s><span>moulent</span></s> mold large shears.</div><div data-layout="middle"><m>Pierres de filieres</m>, which <span>knife grinders</span> use for
whetting, mold very neatly, once scraped, for <m>lead</m>. It is
commonly <m>slate</m>-colored. One frequently brings them to
<span>Toulouse</span> from around <span>Carcassonne</span> .</div></div></folio></body></html>
