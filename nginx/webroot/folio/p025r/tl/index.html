them with barricades or trenches. And there one goes to get
<m>powder</m> in <span>bags</span> or <span>frails</span>. And each piece has
its own <span>frail</span> for loading three or four times. Then, when the
cannon is placed on the platform, one puts a board that is proof of an
arquebus between two gabions. Then a <span>gunner</span> loads it with a
<span>ladle</span>, &amp; with the <span>rammer</span> which is at
<s><span>len</span></s> the other end of the <span>ladle</span>, two men
ram the <m>powder</m> as much as they can, in nine or ten pushes, until
they find the <m>powder</m> to be hard &amp; and well-compacted. Next,
another puts <m>hay</m> or <m>straw</m> and the <s>r</s> others
ram a little. Another puts the ball and the <m>hay</m>-bearer puts in
as much of it as before &amp; one rams a little. Some put
<span><m>wooden</m> bungs</span> but this runs the risk of making the piece
burst. And where one has to fire many <s>cannon</s> shots, one
would need many <span>bungs</span>, which would cost much to carry. Once the
cannon is loaded, xx or xxv <span>pioneers</span> push it forward with
bars, keeping to one side behind the gabions without taking off the
board until the cannon reaches it. Once the cannon is in front, the
<span>gunner</span> mounts it with the <span>wedges</span> which are at the
back, taking the sight on each side and then in the middle. Then another
who is nearby gives fire. Each <s><span>gunner</span></s> cannon needs
3 <span>gunners</span>: the loader, the one who aims, the one who gives
fire. Sometimes, against a camp or into a breach, one shoots cartridges,
made as you have elsewhere, or else one uses a <m>basan</m> full of
<m>flint stones</m>, <m>cart nails</m> &amp; similar.
<s><span>P</span></s> A <s><span>ch</span></s> cannon must not move
unless it has two harnesses, be they of <m>wood</m> or <m>iron</m>. And
to furnish the wheels, powder box, and other furniture of the cannon,
one needs seven <span>quintals</span> and a half of <m>iron</m>.
<s><span>Pour les pre</span></s> The best battery is done at a curtain
wall, some say, <s>for</s> that is, as if at an
<s><span>bieve</span></s> angle, for by doing this you shake loose
several stones.</div><div data-layout="left-bottom" data-layout-hint="extra-wide">





Some put small wheels of the piece and a thick board to the end of the
carriage of the piece in order that it may be drawn more quickly and
without making a noise. Others put <m>leather</m> around the
<s>the</s> wheels &amp; also put <m>leather</m> soles or shoes on
the <span>horses'</span> hooves in order that one does not hear
them.</div></div></folio></body></html>
