removes their eyes &amp;all their entrails. One puts a <span>small
stick</span> vertically between their teeth to make them open their mouths
wide. Then with <span><m>iron points</m></span> one attaches their feet to a
<span>small board</span>, giving them the fitting attitude &amp; gait. Once
thus attached by their feet <add>with <span>small rings of <m>iron
wire</m></span></add>, one needs to suspend them <span>in the sun</span>
with their spines downwards. In this manner they take
<s><span>&amp;d</span></s> their shape &amp; dry, &amp; the belly
tightens &amp; the tail remains high <add>or with the bend that you will
have given it</add>. Once a little dry by this means, one turns the head
as one wants, securing it with some tool. Then one finishes drying it in
an <span>oven</span> when the bread is drawn. Next, one places in its
eye sockets <span>balls of <m>lead</m> or of <m>wax</m></span>, painted
according to nature. One paints them with <m>well-gummed ink</m> so that
they seem to be jet. One gives it a painted tongue, horns, wings &amp;
similar fantasies. Thus for <span>rats</span> &amp; all animals.</div><div data-layout="left-top">
