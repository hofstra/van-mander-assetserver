@<span>The one who <add>makes his profession</add> working in
<m>oil</m></span> will hardly work well in <m>distemper</m> if he has not
been trained well from adolescence. For the way of working is different,
because when washing the <span><span>pinceau</span></span> for <m>distemper</m>,
one always leaves it moist. And on the contrary, when one cleans the
<span><span>pinceau</span></span> in <m>oil</m> to soften, one wipes the
<span><span>pinceau</span></span> well. Otherwise, the work would run &amp;
would soon be disfigured.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



The <span>Italians</span> soften by hatching with a large flattened
<span><span>pinceau</span></span> which makes serrations.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



And they do not lay their shadow all at once like the <span>Flemish</span>,
but make them hatching lightest toward the light then a little darker
next &amp; and finally a little blacker to better make recede &amp; come
up.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



In <m>distemper</m> do not mix your different colors together
<s>But</s> for this makes them die, but use each separately. And in
order that they do not dry &amp; that you have time to soften, moisten
the back of the <m>canvas</m>.</div><div><i>Continued...</i></div></div></folio></body></html>
