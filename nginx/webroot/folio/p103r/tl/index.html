it boil &amp; simmer, but once it is hot put in a <span>quarter</span> as
much of the <m>newest wax</m> you can. Once melted, let it cool, &amp;
once they begin to curdle, stir continuously with a <span><m>new
wooden</m> spatula</span> <s><span>t</span></s> for as long as it takes
you to say <s>one</s> 9 <span>pater nosters</span>, and as you say them,
wash this composition with <m>holy water</m>, stirring all the while.
Having said the first <add>9</add> <span>pater nosters</span>, pour out the
<m>first water</m> &amp; put in new one, &amp; wash &amp; stir the
composition <span><span>for the time it takes you to say 8 pater
nosters</span></span>, and the 3rd time for as long as 7, &amp; and thus
you will consecutively <s>until</s> add <m>new water</m>, doing the
same as above, until the last &amp; single <span>pater noster</span> of
nine. Then you shall have a soft &amp; <m>white ointment</m>, with which
you shall anoint the burn <span><span>for the space of 9 days</span></span>.
But do not apply it any longer than this, for it would cause
<s><span>a</span></s> your <span>flesh</span> to grow excessively. You
<s>b</s> shall bandage yourself <span><span>twice a day</span></span>,
&amp; each time you shall wash your <span>face</span> with <m>water</m>
&amp; <m>wine</m> mixed together, a little tepid, not rubbing, but as if
pressing with <span>wet linen cloth</span>, and you shall wipe it similarly
<s><span>aff</span></s> with a <span>fine linen cloth</span>. &amp; next put
the <m>ointment</m>, over which you can put <m><span>ivy</span> leaves</m>.
This causes <span>hair</span> to regrow &amp; leaves no scar. A
<span>gunpowder maker</span> who had almost completely burnt himself
<s><span>m’a</span></s> &amp; showed no sign of the burn, taught me
this.</div></div><div id="p103r_2"><h2>Against <span>dogs</span>’ mange.</h2><div data-layout="middle">The <span>English</span>, who caress their d<span>ogs</span> a lot for
