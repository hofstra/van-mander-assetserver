<m><span>boxwood</span></m></span>, very round &amp; of the same thickness
everywhere, which has, at the two ends, a little circle, more raised
than the rest, to give the necessary thickness to the <m>paste</m>. And
then, with this <span>rolling pin</span>, flatten it in such a way that it
is <corr>delicate</corr> &amp; thin enough. Then, apply it on the hollow
of your <span>mold</span> and press on it with some <span><m>cotton</m></span>
&amp; your figure will imprint itself in the <m>paste</m>, in relief on
one side &amp; in hollow in the other. This done, anoint with a
<span><span>pinceau</span></span>, wetted in a little <m>melted butter</m>, the
part of the <m>paste</m> which is hollow. Then, cut the
<corr>excess</corr> <m>paste</m>, which surpasses the hollow of the
<span>mold</span> <s><span>H</span></s>. Anoint your <span>mold</span> also with
<m><span>olive</span> oil</m>, as you have done with others, place the
<span><m>clay</m> contour</span> &amp; cast <s><span>s</span></s> your
second mold. And you will have your medal as thin &amp; hollow on one
side as you want. You can have diverse <span>rolling pins</span>, which will
have ends, some more raised than others, to make diverse thicknesses, or
use <span><m>sheets of lead &amp; copper</m></span> of diverse thicknesses
or of <span><m><span>carton</span></m></span>, cut with the <span>rolling
pin</span>.</div><div id="fig_p153v_1" data-layout="left-middle"><img alt="" classname="inline-figure" src="/bnf-ms-fr-640/figures/p153v_1.png"></div><div data-layout="left-middle">

If you would rub your <m>paste</m> with <m>oil</m>, it would drink the
<m>oil</m> &amp; penetrate up to the <span>mold</span>, which it would
attack. But <m>butter</m> remains on the surface of the <m>paste</m>
&amp; is not imbibed at all. One ought not to, on these relief sides,
wet your sand with <m>hot water</m>, for it would melt the
<m>butter</m>.
