<ab>You need to have a big <tl>basin</tl> full of <m>water</m> to

<tl><m>lead</m> bowl</tl> for soaking your sand, a small
<tl><m>wooden</m> spoon</tl> to collect the soaked sand in the
<tl>bowl</tl>. <del>The big <tl>basin</tl> is</del> <del><fr>pour

<head>Molding en <fr>noyau</fr>. Mixture of sand</head>

<ab>Having reheated your sand, namely the <m>plaster</m>, the
<m><fr>alum de plume</fr></m> &amp; the <m>brick</m>, &amp; having
passed them finely <add>through the <tl>sieve</tl>
<mark>#</mark></add>, mix them this way, take four <ms>parts</ms> of
<m>plaster</m>, two of <m>brick</m>, &amp; one of <m><fr>alum de
plume</fr></m>. Mix them all together with your <tl><bp>hands</bp></tl>,
<del><fr>quâ€™il</fr></del> in such a way that one cannot discern one from
the other. With your sand ready, you need to kill the animal that you
want to mold <del><fr>de</fr></del> in this manner.</ab>

<head>Putting to death the animal for molding</head>

<ab>You need to be careful to not wound it in taking it. And having put
it in a <tl><m>glass</m> bottle</tl> <del><fr>d</fr></del> with
<m>bran</m>, or in a <tl>barrel</tl> <del>full</del> half full of
<m>fresh &amp; damp earth</m>, if you want to stock them or keep them a
<tmp>long time</tmp>, give them live <al>frogs</al> &amp; not dead ones
to eat. For if you keep them without feeding them, they wither &amp;
grow thin, &amp; have long wrinkled skins. Thus the best would be to
mold it as soon as <del>after</del> possible
<del><fr>apre</fr></del> after it has been taken. But before, put it to
death it in this way. Place it in a <tl>clean bottle or vessel</tl> so
that it collects no dust. And put inside such a quantity of <m>good
vinegar</m> &amp; <m><bp>urine</bp></m> that it can be covered. And shake it
&amp; torment it therein until it is dead, which will be in <ms><tmp>an hour or a half</tmp></ms>. But if you are in a
hurry</ab>

<ab>
<margin>left-bottom</margin>
To know if it is quite dead, take it out of the <m>vinegar</m> and take
it by the tail. If it moves it, do not mold it for it still has feeling,
&amp; when piercing it, it would retract &amp; spoil the mold.</ab>
