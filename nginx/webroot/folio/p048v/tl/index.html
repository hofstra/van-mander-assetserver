soap</m>, and <span>half a lb</span> of <m>tartar from
<span>Montpellier</span></m>. Once the whole is pulverized, one needs to
boil in a <span>varnished earthenware pot</span> on a big fire while
stirring the whole often with a <span>pick of <m>wood</m> or
<m>iron</m></span>, &amp; the said <m>soap</m> will be consumed and burn
off and the rest will stay more or less red, and it will be necessary
that it is reduced by <span>a third</span>. Then one needs to throw it on a
<span>tile</span> and it will turn blackish. One will need to melt this four
or five times and pour it on the <span>flat tile</span> and then you will
have the <m>regulus</m> drawn from <m>antimony</m>.</div><div data-layout="middle">Others pulverize the <m>antimony</m> &amp; mix it with
<m>saltpeter</m> &amp;<m>pulverized tartar</m>, <span>as much of one as of
the other</span>, &amp;, having heated a <span>pot</span> or <span>crucible</span>
red hot, they put a little of it at a time, &amp; <s><span>se</span></s>
turn their <span>back</span> for fear of the smoke, and continue thus until
everything is put in, and strengthen the fire until everything is
thoroughly melted &amp; melt it again several times.</div></div><div id="p048v_2"><h2><m>Lead</m>, <m>tin</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">They become brittle having been put back to melt often or for a long
time, and they thicken and burn, in such a way that even when one melts
a <span>saulmon</span>, the <m>tin</m> thickens at the bottom if, while
casting, one does not stir it often. It is best for casting to melt a
little <m>lead</m> <s>&amp; the</s> or <m>tin</m> &amp;
<s>stir</s> to renew at each melting. The <m>antimony</m> renders
them breakable. The <m>looking glass tin</m> whitens them.
<s>One</s> <span>Pewterers</span> put in <s>on the <m>fine
tin</m></s> one <span>lb</span> of <m>looking glass tin</m> per one
<span>quintal</span> of <m>fine tin</m> &amp; two <span>lb</span> &amp; a half
or three <span>lb</span> of <m>red &amp; soft copper of cauldrons</m>, which
is better than <m>latten.</m> There is <m>fine &amp; soft tin</m> &amp;
<m>brittle tin</m>. The brittle one is cast in <span><span>grille</span></span>
by the <span>pewterers</span> to sell it better. <s><span>O</span></s>
They come out better &amp; more neatly in <span><m>stone</m> molds</span>
than in a <span><m>copper</m> mold</span>, because <m>copper</m> is fat
&amp; sticks unless one heats the <span>mold</span> well or one casts large
works. Three <span>quarters</span> of <m>lead</m> per one <span>lb</span> of
<m><span>doux</span> tin</m>, makes a very liquid line &amp; proper for
casting, which has a shine like a mirror. <m>Sandever</m> lightens them.
All things that thoroughly lighten <m>metals</m> &amp; remove their
thickness &amp; dense nature &amp; render them <s>like</s> liquid
like <m>water</m>, render them proper for casting, for it is the
thickness that prevents them from running. <m><span>doux</span> tin</m> is
more even <s><span>com</span></s> than the <m>brittle one</m>, which is
whiter and seems to be burnished like a mirror.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

To alloy well <m>tin</m> &amp; <m>lead</m>, one needs to melt one by
itself, and then mix in the other, small pieces at a time, and throw it
often on the <span><m>marble</m></span> or the <span><m>square tile</m></span>.
And when you will see it become quite even <s>like</s> &amp; shiny
as if it were burnished, it is good. For sometimes it becomes spotted
due to too much <m>lead</m> &amp; sometimes due to too much <m>tin</m>.
There is some <m>tin</m> which takes more <m>lead</m> than another.
<m>Common tin</m> is the one that is mixed with <m>lead</m>.</div></div></folio></body></html>
