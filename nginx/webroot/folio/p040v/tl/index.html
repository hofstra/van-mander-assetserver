or else <m><span>Indian</span> <span>laque plate</span></m>, which in my opinion is made
in <span>Flanders</span>, tempered with <m>clear turpentine</m> &amp; tear
of <m>mastic</m> &amp; laid down on a <m>silver</m> leaf, not the kind
which the <span>painters</span> use, but a thicker kind, which is
burnished by <span>those who make <m>gemstone foils</m></span>
<s><span>Av</span></s> or by <span>goldsmiths</span>, &amp; that gives it
this beautiful brilliance.</div></div><div id="p040v_2"><h2><m>Latten</m> and <m>calamine</m></h2><div data-layout="middle"><span>Founders</span> do not melt <m>latten</m> in a

it.</div></div><div id="p040v_4"><h2><m>Aquafortis</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">If your <span>retort</span> is well luted one ought not to surround it
with <span><m>ashes</m></span>, which would only get in the way of chasing
the <m>spirits</m> properly. But when, at the end, you give it violent
fire, surround it with coals which should be lit elsewhere beforehand,
as those in the <span>furnace</span> should be, in order that they do not
crackle &amp; do not make smoke. Put the said lit coals around the body
of the <span>retort</span>, &amp; not close to the neck, which does not need
to be heated as vigorously. The <span>top grate</span>, where you place your
<span>retort</span>, is sufficiently far, one <span><span>dour</span></span> or
<span>half a <ms>foot</ms></span>, from the <span>bottom grate</span> where the
charcoal is placed, for by doing this not as much of it is
wasted.</div></div></folio></body></html>
