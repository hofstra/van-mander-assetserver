When the <span>English</span> have a cold, they mull <m>wine</m> in this
manner. They heat it in a <s>large</s> <span><m>tin</m> pot</span> until
it boils, and when it is boiling up, they <s>remove it from</s>
light it with <span><m>burning paper</m></span> <span>to know if it is hot
enough</span>. Next, to ignite it entirely, they pour it from one
<span>vessel</span> into another, as one who wants to beat <m><span>eau
pan√©e</span></m>, and as they are doing this, someone else lights with a
<m>burning paper</m> what is falling from one <span>vessel</span> into the
other, such that you would think you were pouring fire. When the
<m>wine</m> is mulled enough, heat it again a little, adding a few
<m>cloves</m> &amp; a <span>sufficient quantity</span> of <m>sugar</m>. And
they <s>dri</s> drink it as hot as they can to overcome a cold.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



The common <span>English</span> put <m>sugar</m> in <m>wine</m> to imitate
for themselves the <m>sweet new wine</m> which they cannot have because,
owing to the <span>long sea crossing</span>, the <m>wine</m> has lost its
sweetness and is clarified before it reaches their country.</div></div><div id="p071r_4"><h2>Weary <span>horses</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">For fortifying a harried <span>horse</span>, they make it drink some of
the aforesaid <m>wine</m> through a <span>horn</span>, and it finds itself
disposed for doing an even greater labor.</div></div><div id="p071r_5"><h2><m>Eau-de-vie</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">The <span>Irish</span> do not drink any <m>wine</m> because they convert
it into <m>eau-de-vie</m>, which they use almost as habitually as we use
<m>wine</m>.</div></div></folio></body></html>
