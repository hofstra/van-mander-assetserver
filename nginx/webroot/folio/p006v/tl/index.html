various colors by covering the <m>latten or iron wire</m> with the said
<span>thin canes</span>. These you will break neatly to the length that you
want if you slightly notch with a <span>cutting file</span> at the place to
be broken, and they will not break at any other place. You can bend
<add>them</add> with a <span><m>wood</m> model</span> over a
<span>chafing-dish</span> or else by the heat of the <span>lamp</span>. It can
also be drawn as long as you want in a <span>small furnace</span> made like
a <span>reverberatory furnace</span> but which is pierced on both sides. And
when the large <span>cane</span> is red, they seize the hot end using
<span>small pincers with a long beak</span>, such that one prong of the beak
of the <span>small pincers</span> enters inside the end of the <span>thin
cane</span>, &amp; thus it is lengthened without becoming stopped, &amp;
the other end of the <span>thin cane</span> is held with the <span>hand</span>,
because it is not hot. When the <span>thin cane</span> is stretched enough,
the one who works seated, having his <span>furnace</span>,
the <span>size of a <span>carnation</span> pot</span>, before him,
<corr>breaks</corr> it off &amp; continues. This is for making <span>thin
canes</span> for capes, which are cut as already mentioned, and with a
<span>file</span>. <span>Glass-button makers</span> also avail themselves of
the said <span>furnace</span>.</div></div><div id="null"><div id="fig_p006v_1" data-layout="middle"><img alt="" classname="inline-figure" src="/bnf-ms-fr-640/figures/p006v_1.png"></div><div data-layout="right-middle">

Under the door is a <span>grill</span> that supports the lit charcoal, &amp;

whatever you have pounced and drawn there, next make it neat with a

yet unused, onto <span><m>polished marble</m></span> &amp; flatten it,
making it quite thin, with a <span><m>wooden</m> board</span>. Or else pour
it on a <span>table</span> as is done with <m>lead</m>, or put it through a
<span>roll-press</span>. Next lay your <m>tin</m> plate over the etched thing,
&amp; over the <m>tin</m> plate put a <span>piece of <m>felt</m></span> and
strike it with a <span>hammer</span>. Then <m>gild</m> it in the following
