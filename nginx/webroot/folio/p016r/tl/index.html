cannot be melted again because they only heat it in <span>small
forges</span>, in which it only becomes red-hot. <span>Alchemists</span>
undertake to melt it with <m>realgar</m> or <m>lead</m> or <m>mixed
orpiment</m>. But without all that, some have found a manner of
<s>the</s> melting not only <m>brittle iron</m>, such as the kind used
for <span><m>iron</m> pots</span>, but also <m><span>douls</span> iron</m> such
as <s><span>d</span></s> that of pigs &amp; ingots, which is the most
difficult kind. And to this effect they make a <span>furnace</span> in this
manner which has a width of one <span><span>pan</span> &amp; a half</span> &amp;
<s>one <span><span>pan</span> &amp; a half </span>of</s> a depth of two
<span><span>pans</span></span>. And the <span>tuelle</span>, which is the barrel
<s>through</s> marked A through which the bellows' pipes enter, has
to be placed in the middle of the depth of the <span>furnace</span> such
that there is one <span><span>pan</span></span> of the mouth of the
<span>furnace</span> above the <span>tuelle</span> &amp; one
<span><span>pan</span></span> underneath.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

Each <span><span>pan</span></span> of the mouth of the <span>square furnace</span>
contains <span>one &amp; a half quintal</span>, &amp; the
<span><span>pan</span></span> of the <span>round furnace</span> holds two
<span>quintals</span>.</div><div><i>Continued...</i></div></div><div id="null"><div id="fig_p016r_1" data-layout="left-middle"><img alt="" classname="inline-figure" src="/bnf-ms-fr-640/figures/p016r_1.png"></div><div data-layout="right-middle">

The <span>miners</span>, to make the <m>iron</m> run, put at the mouth of
the melt, two or three <span><span>handfuls</span></span> of
<m><span>wallwort</span></m> when they want to make the <m>melt</m> run, and
this renders the <m>iron</m> wonderfully ductile and flowing.</div></div><div id="null"><div data-layout="middle">It is also necessary that the <span>tuelle</span> enters through to the
middle of the mouth of the<span>furnace</span>, which is a principal part of
the secret because the wind will hit the edge &amp; the wall which makes
up the belly of the <span>furnace</span> &amp; by such means, it spreads
equally everywhere &amp; above, like the flame in a <span>reverberatory
furnace</span>, &amp; by such means heats much more; for if the wind were
to hit directly from above, the substance which is melted or ready to be
melted, it would cool it down &amp; prevent it from running &amp;
melting. It is also necessary for the bellows to be driven by the
falling &amp; running of <m>water</m> as in <span>forges</span>, because in
this manner, the bellows run with measure &amp; compass &amp; with great
speed, which the strength of <span>workers</span> could <s>d</s> not
do. Therefore one raises the wall as you see &amp; the <span>furnace</span>
on the surface of the ground at the edge of which you make a channel as
with other founding, to put the <span>molds</span> of that which you want to
cast &amp; to do this, you unstop the opening that you had made at the
bottom of the <span>furnace</span> to make the melted substance run. You
will be able to melt two <span>quintals</span> of <m>iron</m> each time and
to do this, you will choose the <span><span>biggest</span> charcoal</span> you
can find &amp; put a load of it at the bottom, on the plane and surface
of the <span>furnace</span> &amp; with the bottom piling up <s>as if</s>
to a point, up to the top of the wall

Some make a mold of the <span>calibre</span> of the piece, &amp; temper it,
then beat a <m><span>doulx </span>iron</m> piece cut to size, &amp; when
this piece is very red, they beat it into the <span>mold</span> &amp; round
it off with a <span>large file</span>, considering these balls to be
stronger than the melted ones which, being brittle, are more subject to
breaking.</div></div></folio></body></html>
