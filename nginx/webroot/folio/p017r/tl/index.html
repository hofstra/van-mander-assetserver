The cannon fires at point blank from five to six hundred <span>paces</span>.
But not for battering, in which it can only perform well from two
hundred <span>paces</span>, or three hundred <s><span>paces</span></s> at
the most, and it should not be any farther. Its ball usually weighs 40
<span>lb</span> of the <span><span><span>King</span></span>'s caliber</span>. There is
a <span>cannon-perrier</span>, which weighs xxv <span>quintals</span>, which are
small, short cannons. It is for fighting the <span>ditch casemates</span>
&amp; for battering at close range. It bears a large ball of the
<span><span><span>King</span></span>'s caliber</span> like the others, namely of
40 <span>lb</span>. It bears in the breech only the <span>width of two balls
&amp; a quarter of a ball</span>. The front only bears the <span>width of
one ball &amp; a third of a ball</span>. Its charge is similar to those of
bigger ones, namely xx. And for this reason, when one wants to try them
<s><span></span></s>, one ought not to over-charge it, for this damages the
piece. And for the first time &amp; until it has fired five or six
<s>pieces</s> shots, it is better not to give its complete charge,
for the piece is still proving itself. And the test that one can do is
to give it a charge of xx <span>lb</span> of <m>fine arquebus powder</m>
instead of <m>ordinary cannon powder</m>. And four good <span>horses</span>
are sufficient to drag them. They are easy, &amp; close up they have as
much force as the big ones, especially for <span>private houses</span>
&amp; <span>small towns</span> &amp; <span>fortresses of little
importance</span>. They are no more subject to bursting than the others
because they are short. For that which gives great strength to the
<m>powder</m> &amp; in danger of bursting <add>at the piece</add>, is
the length of the piece, because the <m>powder</m> is burned entirely
before exiting, &amp; <s>the</s> its impetuosity is held constrained
for longer in a <s>small</s> long piece than a
<s><span>gr</span></s> short one. The cannon-perrier is usually seven to
eight <span><span>pans</span></span> long. It is true that this is a
<span><span>pan</span> of <span>Montpellier</span></span> &amp; not a
<span><span><span>King</span></span>’s pan</span>, which is not used in the
founding of guns for making them good. For the <span><span>pan</span> of
<span>Montpellier</span></span> being <s>of</s> shorter, the cannons
<s>more</s> proportioned there are shorter also, &amp;compensate in
thickness <s><span>ce</span></s> the length that they would have by the
<span><span><span>King</span></span>’s <span>pan</span></span>, by which measure they
will be found longer. But also they would be thinner. <s>The
great</s> <s>canno</s> The strength of the cannon-perrier for
making a battery is 4xx <span>paces</span>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



The <add>great</add> cannon, because of the weight of its ball, carries
a range of only a thousand or xii hundred <span>paces</span> without
landing, &amp;bouncing, usually it bounces iii times.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



The cannon-perrier does not have a large effect if not close.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



One recognizes the good alloy of a piece by seeing it. For if, with the
greenness which they expel on the surface, they redden, that is to say
that they are composed of a sufficient quantity of
<m><span>rosette</span></m>. If not, they are only of <m>metal</m>, which
shows up whitish. If they themselves do not make this demonstration,
scratch &amp; you will see. </div><div data-layout="left-middle">



The good alloy for pieces is of <span>three parts of
<m><span>rosette</span></m> &amp; one of the <m>fine metal from a
<s><span>la</span></s> large bell</m></span>, where there is more
<m><span>rosette</span></m> than in the <m>metal of small bells</m>. The
<m>metal</m> usually costs xv <span><span>lb</span></span> &amp; <m>fine
<span>rosette</span></m> xv or xvi.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



The <span><span><span>pan</span> of <span>Montpellier</span></span></span> is equivalent
to six of the <span><span><span><span>King</span></span>’s inches</span></span>, which
contains in it two common. </div><div data-layout="left-bottom" data-layout-hint="wide">





It is necessary, for <s>a</s> mounting a piece well, that it be as
high at the side of the mouth as at the breech. Otherwise, one does not
mount well.
