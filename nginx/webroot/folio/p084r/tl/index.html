dry slowly, in some <span>dry place</span> &amp; not over a big fire, it
would be better, for when one exposes it all at once to intense heat, it
warps. I believe that reheating it at the mouth of the <span>oven</span>,
<span>after the bread has been taken out</span>, would be very proper. One
ought not to complain about the difficulty of preparing it, for it
withstands as many castings as you wish, because it renders itself as
hard as <m>marble</m> &amp; you can polish it, &amp; the <span>mold</span>
cannot be spoiled. Once used, pestle &amp; <span>sieve</span> it again, yet
without being scrupulous to render it so fine,

before putting it to use. One pulverises it, because it is in a lump,
then one reheats it in a <span><m>copper</m> kettle</span> or similar thing,
until it no longer smokes.</div><div data-layout="left-bottom">

It is necessary to reheat it before using it. It is rendered better for
casting because it is reheated, but when it has been used a lot, one
ought to refresh it with new sand.</div></div></folio></body></html>
