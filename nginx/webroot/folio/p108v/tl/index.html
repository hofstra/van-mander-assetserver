<s><span>p</span></s><m><add>b</add> small stones</m>, purging it of its
impurities. Then one puts it to cook neatly in a
<s><span><span>pot</span></span></s> <add><span>earthen vessel</span></add> in
the <span>furnace of <span>those who make <tl>pots</tl></span></span>, and one
leaves it there until the <span>pots</span> are cooked. Next, one mixes it
again with <m>essence of sal ammoniac</m> &amp; one grinds it very well,
and one empties the <m>muddy &amp; clean water</m> in a separate
<span>vessel</span>. Again, one puts the same <m>essence</m> on top &amp;
one grinds &amp; again one puts the <m>muddy water</m> with the other.
And one does thus, until it has passed everything. In this way, one
purges &amp; cleanses it, &amp; one renders it very fine &amp;
handleable. Having taken away the <m>water</m>, by tilting it or with a
<span>sponge</span>, one takes the residue and one dries it. Then,
moistening it with the aforementioned <m>water</m>, like one does with
the other <s><m><span>eau</span></m></s> sand, one uses it in a
<span>frame</span>, where, if it retracts, it is a sign that it
has not reheated enough &amp; that one needs to reheat it further. This
one is appropriate for molding all <m>metals</m>, and especially
<m>gold</m> &amp; <m>silver</m>, and the more it is used the better it
is. One needs to set aside the one in which you cast <m>lead</m> or
<m>tin</m>, for it would sour the <m>gold</m> you would cast.</div><div data-layout="middle"><rub><m><span>Alum de plume</span></m></rub> should be reheated in a

with a <span><m>tile</m></span></add> in a strong <s><span>flamme</span></s>
<add>charcoal</add> fire, in order that the impurities which could be there
is burned with that which does not burn. This is done either in the
<span><span>goldsmith</span>’s forge</span>, <span>surrounded with
<m>bricks</m></span>, or in a <span><span>fourneau à vent</span></span> with

<span><span>quarter hour</span></span></add>. This is done more to cleanse it
than for anything else. It becomes reddish on the surface &amp; on the
inside it remains white &amp; better dried out <mark>#</mark></div><div data-layout="left-middle">

<mark>#</mark> After your <m><span>alum de plume</span></m> is cooled,
pestle it in a <span>mortar</span>, then grind it on the
<span><m>marble</m></span>, and it will be rendered in very fine wooly
filaments, which gives binding to the sand, without getting burned as
other things do, which is a fine invention. Pestle it in the
<span>mortar</span>, by dragging the <span>pestle</span>, for the flying dust
could enter your <span>throat</span> or land on your <span>face</span>, which
will give you reason <span>to scratch yourself well</span>. Put a little
every time in the <span>mortar</span>, to avoid the flying dust. It is
better to grind it thus, in the <span>mortar</span>, dragging the
<span>pestle</span>, than on the <span><m>marble</m></span>,
<s><span>car</span></s> where <s><span>c</span></s> it spreads &amp; in
the <span>mortar</span>, it collects on all sides. Render it very fine &amp;

it in a <span>pit</span> or in a <span><span>terrine</span></span> and make numerous
holes with a <span>stick</span> in it, which fill with <m>water</m>, in
