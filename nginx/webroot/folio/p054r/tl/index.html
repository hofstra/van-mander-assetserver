when they want to climb up when, on the leaf, they
<s><span>hau</span></s> lengthen &amp; raise the head &amp; a part of
the body. At that time one carries them to the <span>heather</span> branches
where they stop &amp; begin to spin their prison, which one calls
cocoon, commonly the <span>size of a <span>pigeon</span> egg</span>, although
one finds much larger ones because it sometimes happens that two or
three &amp; up to xi <span>worms</span> are put in a cocoon, which is hairy
&amp; downy all around <s>&amp;</s>, the hair of which is
<m>ferret-silk</m> or
<m><span>floret</span></m>; &amp; from the
cocoon, which is a white, solid, continuous &amp; firm skin, <m>silk</m>
is made. The cocoon is so hard that one only cuts it with difficulty
with a <span><span>fingernail</span></span>. And nevertheless, to leave its
prison, <s><span>elle</span></s> the <span>worm</span> gnaws it at one end,
&amp; after <add>having</add> stayed inside living on its own sap
<s><span>il</span></s> for three <span><span>weeks</span></span>, it comes
out, diminished <span>by half</span>. For when it begins to spin, it is
<span>as long as a <span>ring finger</span></span> &amp; has eight feet, &amp;
coming out it <span>shorter by half</span> &amp; only has 4 feet. On the
other hand, it has become a <span>butterfly</span> &amp; has wings, without
flying however. And there are male &amp; female. As soon as they come
out of the cocoon, the male charges the female &amp; one puts them on a
<span>white linen</span>, where they make their eggs. Which female would not
be good &amp; profitable if the male was not given to her. And when the
male has detached himself from a female, one needs to throw it, for it
would not be good to give it to another. They have completed spinning
&amp; making their eggs in three <span><span>weeks</span></span> &amp;
<span>around <span>Saint John</span>'s Day</span>. And at that time one keeps
their eggs &amp; seed <span><span>until Holy Week</span></span>, as
<s><span>on</span></s> is said. Some spin among the leaves &amp; make
their cocoon there without climbing high.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">
