<span>in <span>serain</span></span>, but they are better for fattening for
fine tables than for singing. <span>Chaffinches</span> are prone to becoming
blind, &amp; their eyes become swollen at the <span>beginning of
August</span>. <span>Goldfinches</span> like <span>lettuce</span> seeds very
much, &amp; often one catches them in <span>gardens</span> on seeded
<span>lettuces</span> with two <span>lime-twigs</span>. But because such regular
fare would be too expensive for them, they are ordinarily fed with
<span>hemp</span> seed. The <span><span>passe solitaire</span></span> is purged
with a <m><span>spider</span></m>, which one needs to give to it
<span><span>once a week</span></span> in order that no
<span>gaillardisse</span> comes to it. The <span>calandra</span> is purged with <m>dry
mortar</m>, composed of <m>lime</m> &amp; sand to keep it from
<span>gaillardise</span> &amp; fattening too much. <span>Young small
birds</span> are purged with the same <m>dry mortar</m>, by putting some
pieces in their <span>cages</span>. The <span>cuckoo</span> lays in the nest of
<span><span>benarris</span></span> otherwise called <span><span>verdaule</span></span>.
This <span>bird</span> is very simple. I have heretofore given leave to two,
which <span>after several days</span> returned to their cage. For feeding
young <span>goldfinches</span>, one needs to <span>pestle</span>
<m><span>almonds</span></m> with <s><m>pith</m></s> a very little amount
of <m><add>bread pith</add></m> and <m>l<span>ettuce</span> seed</m> or
<m><span>hemp</span> seed</m>. If it is for <span>linnet</span>, some
<m><span>rapeseed</span></m>.</div></div><div id="p050v_2"><h2>Curried <m>steel</m> and <span>files</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">The <m>steel</m> that <span>blacksmiths</span> &amp; <span><m>iron</m>
