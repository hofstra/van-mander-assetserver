and rustic construction</h2><div data-layout="middle"><span>Swallows</span> have taught us this craft, making their nests out
of <m>mud</m> mixed with <m>wisps</m> &amp; <m>stalks of hay or
straw</m> to make it bond. Therefore, in places where <m>stone</m> &amp;
<m>brick</m> are lacking, one can use <m>earth</m> to make partitions
&amp; <span>walls</span>. And for this, <m>light earth</m>, which does not
form clumps when plowed, but which is as if intermixed with
<m><span>arene</span></m>, holds first rank, because it can be beaten &amp;
tamped down better. It is true that it needs to be moistened &amp;
<s><span>la</span></s> cut into clods with a <span>ditch-spade</span>, and
thus place &amp; arrange it. This one lasts longer and does not require
as much effort, and <s><span>ne</span></s> dryness does not make it
crack &amp; split. But, because such kinds of <m>earth</m> are not found
everywhere, those who are on <span>good &amp; fertile land</span>, after
marking out with a <span>measuring line</span> the width &amp; length of
their foundations, drive <s>into the ground</s> in along the
foundation edges, on this side &amp; that, <span>long poles</span>
<s>&amp;</s> or <span>chevron beams</span> to support <span>boards</span>
between which <corr>they</corr> throw the <m>earth</m>, making each
layer one <span><span>foot</span></span> thick or thereabouts, intermixing it
with <mark>S.S.S</mark>-like <m>branches of <span>heather</span></m> or
similar things, then with <span>beaters</span> of <corr>three</corr>
different forms they tamp it &amp; beat it. One is called the
<span>mallet</span>, which has a triangular form like A, and with this, one
first tamps the <m>earth</m>. Next one uses the one made of <m>blocks of
wood</m>pointed at the tip &amp; helved to a large stick, &amp; this one
is for pressing the <m>earth</m> well at the extremities and edges of
the <span>wall</span>, which adhere to the <span>boards</span>, &amp; is
called. The other one is called the
<span>bat</span>, which is for flattening &amp; beating the <m>earth</m> for
the last time, as shown in .C. Then one makes another layer of
<m>earth</m> <add>&amp; <m><span>heather</span></m></add> and beats it as
was said, &amp; continues thus until the <span>wall</span> is complete,
which one covers with <m><span>heather</span></m> &amp; then with
<m>earth</m>. Some <s><span>m</span></s> intermix the said
<span>wall</span> with rows of <m>bricks</m>. They also make the
<span>wall</span> tapering, giving <s><span>a</span></s> width to the
foundations according to how high one wants to raise the
<span>wall</span>. Which, when old, whitens, &amp; thereby shows that it
has <m>saltpeter</m> in it. That is why, when they fall down,
<span>gunpowder makers</span> profit from them.</div><div id="fig_p014r_1" data-layout="left-middle"><img alt="" classname="inline-figure" src="/bnf-ms-fr-640/figures/p014r_1.png"></div></div></folio></body></html>
