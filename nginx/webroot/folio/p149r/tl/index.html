<m>sublimate</m> than the others. Wet all of this together like paste
&amp; with this impaste the <m>iron</m>, &amp; to do this envelope it
with some <span><m>bad linen</m></span>. Then make it reheat until it is
very red. Or leave <span><span>overnight</span> in a good fire until the

<m>electrum</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">One calls it <m>gold from the <span>Rhine</span></m>, which one finds
in the <span>rivers</span>, and is <m>spangle gold</m>.
<span>Goldsmiths</span> from <span>Germany</span> wanted to refine it,
thinking to separate it from this whiteness which they deemed to be
<m>silver</m>. But it always remains whiteish, which demonstrates that
this whiteness is fixed &amp; it does not lack color. This is
<span><m>electrum</m></span>, from which one is able to make cups,
which will demonstrate <md>poison</md>.</div></div><div id="p149r_3"><h2>Various arts from <span>Germany</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">They are very much helped by <span><span>water </span>mills</span>, &amp;
