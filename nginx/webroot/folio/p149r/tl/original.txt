<head>Softening <m>iron</m> and rendering it very soft</head>

<ab>Take <m>sublimate</m>, <m>quicklime</m>, <m>soap from
<pl>Venice</pl></m>, <m><al>horse</al> dung</m>, a little less
<m>sublimate</m> than the others. Wet all of this together like paste
&amp; with this impaste the <m>iron</m>, &amp; to do this envelope it
with some <tl><m>bad linen</m></tl>. Then make it reheat until it is
very red. Or leave <ms><tmp>overnight</tmp> in a good fire until the
<tmp>morning</tmp></ms>. It will be very soft for engraving on it well
whatever you want.</ab></div>

<head><m>Base gold from <pl>Germany</pl></m>,
<m>electrum</m></head>

<ab>One calls it <m>gold from the <pl>Rhine</pl></m>, which one finds
in the <env>rivers</env>, and is <m>spangle gold</m>.
<pro>Goldsmiths</pro> from <pl>Germany</pl> wanted to refine it,
thinking to separate it from this whiteness which they deemed to be
<m>silver</m>. But it always remains whiteish, which demonstrates that
this whiteness is fixed &amp; it does not lack color. This is
<df><m>electrum</m></df>, from which one is able to make cups,
which will demonstrate <md>poison</md>.</ab></div>

most of the<pro> artisans of <m>metals</m>, of <m>gold</m>, &amp; of
<m>silver</m>, &amp; others</pro>, at the <tl>trip hammers</tl>,
<del>make</del> get their large works beaten. And to draw <m>iron
wire</m>, they redden large masses of <m>iron</m>, &amp; having made it
into a point, they make it hang while totally red, &amp; thus promptly
draw the <m>wire</m>.</ab></div>

<ab>If you want to mold any medal to serve as your pattern, &amp; at the
same time repair it, cast it in a majority of <m>tin</m> &amp; put in a
copious amount of <m>looking-glass tin</m> to harden it.</ab></div>
