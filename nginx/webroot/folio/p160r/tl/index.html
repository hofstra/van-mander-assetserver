&amp; run freely the length of the <span>pillars</span>, &amp; that the
lower one is fixed. At the end of the <span>pillars</span> is affixed an
<m>iron</m> <span>St Andrews</span> cross, in the middle of which is a
<span>screw</span> which tightens the <span>plates</span> against the
<span>molds</span> which are between the two. Or, for small <span>molds</span>,
one makes a <span>frame</span>, &amp; having put the <span>molds</span> between
two <span>plates of <m>iron</m></span>, one <s>sets</s> tightens them in
the <span>frame</span> with <span>wedges</span>. The <span>large <m>wooden</m>
presses made with screws</span>, besides being heavy to put near to the
<span>forge</span> for casting, one cannot know when they tighten too much,
&amp; very often they break the <span>mold</span>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

The <span>screw</span> is riveted to this <span>stirrup</span> which is
<span>nailed</span> on to the upper <span>plate</span>, &amp; by this means,
raises it &amp; <span>presses</span> it.

constricts them &amp; reduces them as if massed together. Take heed
therefore to wet it until thin, &amp; blow thoroughly before the flower
is covered. Cast at the side of the <span>mold</span>. And wetting the sand,
one ought not only turn the <span>spatula</span>, but beat the sand in
<m>water</m> as if you were beating <m>glair of egg</m>.</div></div></folio></body></html>
