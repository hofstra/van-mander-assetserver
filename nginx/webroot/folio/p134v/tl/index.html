One needs not only to <span>clamp</span> the <span>molds</span>well, but to

If some piece of small foot does not come out well in <m>gold</m> or
<m>silver</m>, by fault of not having made, underneath, a gate of
<m>wax</m>, beat some <m>soldering gold</m> very thinly, then cut it in
as many small spangles as you need. Take some of this <m><span>phlegm
</span></m> or <m><span>white thick <s>which</s> saliva that is found on
the <bp>teeth</bp></span></m>, &amp; with the point of a <span>burin</span>,
apply it to the place you want to <m>solder</m> &amp; place there a
<m>little spangle of gold</m> &amp; next, with a little <m>fat
earth</m>, wet with <m><span>saliva</span></m>, make a small layer, on the
opposite side, to hold <m>solder</m> better. Next, pulverize on top a
little <m>borax</m> &amp; put in the fire. <m>Boiled water of
<span>quince</span> seed</m> &amp; others also.</div></div></folio></body></html>
