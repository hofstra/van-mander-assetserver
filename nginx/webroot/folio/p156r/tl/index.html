you will have a hollow, in which you can cast <span>en noyau</span> a relief
<add>of your sand</add>, on which you will make a hollow of <m>lead</m>
or <m>tin</m>, in which you will cast a <m>wax</m> relief. And then on
that <m>wax</m> you will make your <span>mold</span> in a hollow
<span>noyau</span>, to cast in it the relief of <m>gold</m> &amp;
<m>silver</m> or any other <m>metal</m> you like. But to hasten your
work if you are in a hurry, make the first imprint &amp; hollow in
<m>bread pith</m>, prepared as you know, which will mold very neatly.
And into that, cast <m>melted wax</m>, which will give you a beautiful
relief, on which you will make your <span>noyau</span>.</div></div><div id="p156r_2"><h2>Very light and hollow work of <m>gold</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">Cast a <span>lizard</span> or any medal you like in <m>base silver</m>,
like <span>billon</span>. Next, <m>gild</m> it lightly. And once the first
<m>gilding</m> is done &amp; dried by fire, quicken, rub with a
<span>scratch-brush</span>, &amp; make another layer of light <m>gilding</m>
like the first time, &amp; do thus three or four times or more,
according to the thickness you want to give. And then, having made a
small hole in the least visible place, put your work into <m>good
aquafortis</m>, which penetrating to the <m>silver</m> through the hole
will eat it all away without damaging the <m>gold</m>, so that you will
have a <span>lizard</span> hollow to its nails, or any other work, so light
that by blowing you will agitate it. But take heed not to make the layer
of <m>amalgamated gold</m> all at once, or of hardly any thickness each
time, because that would block the small features; but proceeding
therein as said, lightly &amp; several times, <add>and cleaning
well</add>, you would do well.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

In order for the <m>aquafortis</m> to eat away better, it is necessary
to <s>cast</s> cast in <m>base silver</m>.</div></div><div id="p156r_3"><h2><span>Chasing</span></h2><div data-layout="middle"><m>Lead</m> is so fat &amp; soft that one cannot strike it boldly,

<span><span>onglet</span></span> you make &amp; retrace the more delicate lines,
with the <span>ordinary engraving burin</span> the broader ones, and with
the <span><span>chaple</span></span>, you remove the big flashing, and with the
