brought to boil so that it is hardly strong. Next stir in a little
<m>honey</m> to soften it, &amp; make it boil all together. And on top
of this layer, which will soon be dry, you will be able to paint in
<m>oil</m>, which will soften the layer even more, and which can also
serve to make a ground for <m>gold</m>. <m>Water of alum</m> also
