<head>For painting in <m>oil</m> on <m>taffeta</m> <add>without the
<m>oil</m> running</add></head>

<ab>One needs to make a layer of <m><fr>batture</fr></m>, which is made
<del>of well-cooked honey &amp; <m>turpentine</m></del> of <m><fr>colle
forte</fr></m> soaked for 24 <ms>hours</ms> in <m>water</m> then gently
brought to boil so that it is hardly strong. Next stir in a little
<m>honey</m> to soften it, &amp; make it boil all together. And on top
of this layer, which will soon be dry, you will be able to paint in
<m>oil</m>, which will soften the layer even more, and which can also
serve to make a ground for <m>gold</m>. <m>Water of alum</m> also
keeps <m>oil</m> from running.</ab>

<head>For whitening <m>ceruse</m></head>

<ab>Hard-boil <m>eggs, divide them in half &amp; take the yolk out,
&amp; between the two halves of the white</m> put a piece of
<m>ceruse</m>, &amp; tie them together with <tl>thread</tl>. Then boil
in <m>clear water</m>, &amp; it will become entirely black, &amp; thus
the <m>ceruse</m> will be purified. Some reheat it over fire &amp; it
becomes very white.</ab>
