hour</span></span></h2><div data-layout="middle">
Some take 2 <span>℥</span> of <m>mastic</m>, <span>half ℥</span> of <m>turpentine</m> &amp; <span>half ℥</span> of
<m>turpentine oil</m> &amp; <m>eau-de-vie</m>, a little at your discretion, 
because it evaporates when heated &amp; nonetheless makes the <m>varnish</m> more desiccative. But I made
it thus: I take <m>turpentine oil</m> at discretion &amp; put in a good
bit of <m>turpentine</m>, because it remains always moist &amp; attaches
itself if one puts in too much, &amp; <m>eau-de-vie</m>, &amp; heat in a
<span>varnished bowl</span> the said <m>oil</m>, &amp; when it begins to be
very hot, I put in some <m>subtly ground mastic</m> &amp; around
<span>one-third</span> of the <m>oil</m> passed through a <span>sieve</span>
<s>l</s>, and let reheat until it is melted, which will be soon on
hot <m>ashes</m>. Once all melted, try it on the <span>knife</span>, and if
you see that it has too much body, add in a little <m>turpentine
oil</m>, and if it does not have enough, add in <m>mastic</m>, and thus
it well be done. And keep it well covered so that no filth gets in. When
you want to make it, be careful to sort &amp; choose the <m>mastic</m>
that is white &amp; purified of any dirt &amp; dust &amp; black dross.
And when you wash it &amp; dry it to render it very white &amp; clean,
it will be even better. For if you do not purge it well, these
<m><span>straws</span></m> &amp; marks, pulverised into it, will remain
within the <m>varnish</m>, &amp; when you set it on white or carnation,
it will appear that they are <span>fleas</span> &amp; blemishes. Once well
chosen, pulverise it in a <span>mortar</span> and pass it through a <span>very
fine sieve</span>, and next mix it in <m>oil</m>, as is said. But if you
want to make it more carefully, extract a tear of <m>mastic</m>, as you
know, pulverise, pass, &amp; mix, and you will have something very
singular for small works. Take heed when varnishing not to breathe on
it, for this will make the <m>varnish</m> whiten &amp; take body.</div><div data-layout="left-top">



It almost dries when working.</div><div data-layout="left-top">



One knows that this <m>varnish</m> does not have body enough when it
does not take well on a panel in <m>oil</m> for it is like <m>water</m>.
Add in therefore <m>pulverized mastic</m> &amp; heat until it is good.
This <m>varnish</m> is very white &amp; beautiful, &amp; does not go to
your head like that of <m><span>spike lavender</span></m>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



For some, instead of <s><span>tour</span></s> <m>turpentine oil</m>, put
<m><span>spike lavender</span> oil</m>, which is not as good.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



This <m>varnish</m> is laid down cold on the panel with a very clean
<span><span>fingertip</span></span>, &amp; one needs to spread it
vigorously.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



The <span>Italians</span> scarcely varnish their paintings because they lay
their paintings very thick &amp; they are a <span>long time</span> drying
on the inside, though on top they make a dry skin &amp; crust.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



One lays the <m>varnish</m> with a <span><span>finger</span></span> so as make a
lean layer, because when thick, it yellows.</div></div><div id="p097v_2"><h2>Painting on <m>glass</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">

It is a strange thing that the <span>workers</span> of this art cannot
work well if they do not have good <span>breath</span>, for if they have a
bad one, their work will break in the fire when re-heated.</div></div></folio></body></html>
