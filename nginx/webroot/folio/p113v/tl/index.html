If you want to cast in <m>lead</m> or <m>tin</m> - because one would

promptly with a <span><m>wooden</m> spoon</span>, it does not become thicker
than <m><s>clear</s> mustard</m>. And thus throw

es</span></s> as is always at the surface, in shakes &amp;
<s><span>da</span></s> at the top of your <span>mold</span>. And doing so,
since your animal is nearly covered, blow strongly everywhere in order
to dissipate the small and big bubbles that the wet sand makes &amp;
continue without delay to put all the rest which is at the bottom, &amp;
a little thicker than the top, until everything is filled, up to the
mark for thickness that you made.

<s><span>affin</span></s> while throwing, in order that the wet sand runs
&amp; enters well everywhere. Also tip your <span>mold</span> up on the side
of the head, which is higher than the body, and thus your <span>mold</span>
will have the same thickness, &amp; you will spare sand. All of this
being carefully done <s><span>fai</span></s>, let it set, which will
take a <span><span>quarter of an hour</span></span>. Then release the
<m>clay</m> circle, which can be used another time. And leave it to dry
a little bit, &amp; separate your <span>mold</span> from the
<span>tourtelle</span> <m>earth</m>, which also <s><span>de</span></s> will
be appropriate for molding right away, and pare the excess with a big
<span>knife</span>, giving to it the long shape of a <span>mandore</span>.
<s><span>Rasche</span></s> Scrape &amp; cut also away the back <add>of
the <span>mold</span></add>, which is always the weakest, and adapt it
cleanly thus. And do not forget to make notches around, in order that the
second cast anchors itself there &amp; binds better

Make it clear like a <m>broth of juices</m>, or like <m>starchy

there is no risk in it being very clear, because sand always settles in

If you don't fill in one go your <span>mold</span>

<m>Essence of sal ammoniac</m> is not necessary for small
<span>molds</span>, which do not require neither a big nor a long fire to be
reheated, however, when you put some in it will only be better. <span></span>
