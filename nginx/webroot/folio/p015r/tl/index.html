embroidery without adding anything else to it, in this way. Once it is
<m>dyed</m> yellow, pounce onto it such a pattern as will please you.
Then you will baste some <m>string</m> or a thicker <m>cord</m> onto the
pouncing and thrust it into a <m>dye</m> of <m><span>guesde woad</span></m>
or <m><span>pastel woad</span></m> &amp; it will become green, except that
which is beneath the <m>string</m>, which will remain yellow because the
<m>green dye</m> will not have penetrated there. And you can do thus
with other colors, and instead of <m>cord</m> or <m>string</m>, add some
pieces of <m>paltry cloth</m>, cut into moresque shapes, on top of the
first color. In that manner, you will have cheap embroidery.</div></div><div id="p015r_2"><h2>Foundry casting</h2><div data-layout="middle">One casts candlesticks and small works in a <span>frame</span> with
sand. And after having imprinted the work, one sprinkles it with
<m>flour</m> in order to make the <s><span>e metal</span></s>
<m>copper</m> or <m>latten</m> run better. When the sand has been used
for a <span>month</span>, it is necessary to take some new, because the one
that was used, having been reheated <s>in fire</s>
<mark>+</mark>, dries out &amp; loses its ability to bond. However,
it is used to mix among the new, for it makes the work not so porous.
One casts large works such as artillery, bells &amp; similar things in
<m>earth</m>, &amp; <m>copper</m> cast in <m>earth</m> makes less of a
<span>chappe</span>, and is whiter than the one cast in sand. The
<m>earth</m> is <m>sandy clay</m> mixed with <m><span>horse</span> dung</m>
&amp; <m>cloth waste</m>. That which <s>is</s> has been used for
founding, which is black, cooked &amp; as if burnt, is used to cast,
<s><span>gecte</span></s> mixed with <m>artificial sand</m>, &amp; is
very good. <mark>/</mark> <add>To soften &amp; make the <m>copper</m> run, throw in,
once it is melted, a little <m>lead</m>, which does not form an alloy
but is found on the surface of the cast.</add></div><div data-layout="left-middle">

&amp; reheated well in the <span>frame</span>, because, if it were humid,
like <m><span>founder</span>'s sand</m>, the <m>gold</m> and <m>silver</m>
would spatter, &amp; cause damage. It is also necessary for the
<m>earth</m> to drink the <m>metal</m>, for cast <m>gold</m> or
<m>silver</m> <s>is</s> becomes very spongy. That is why it must be
beaten again, otherwise it is brittle, as one sees in spoon
handles.</div></div></folio></body></html>
