not-too-thick <m>gum</m> <s>or</s> because <m>oil</m> takes a
<span>long time</span> to dry, and it runs if it is transparently layered,
as the herbs require. And if you still want it <add>done</add> promptly,
mix your color with <m>glair</m> beaten with <m>peelings of the <span>fig tree</span></m>, 
and your work will soon be dry. But layer it
transparently.</div></div><div id="p129r_2"><h2>For <span>wormseed</span></h2><div data-layout="middle"> The pallid white of this herb is made from <m>green verditer</m>,
<m>white lead</m> or <m>ceruse</m>, a bit of <m>massicot</m>, <m>stil de
grain yellow</m>, and <m><span>cendr√© d'azur</span></m>. Mix &amp; compose
your color according to a natural branch that you will have. </div></div><div id="p129r_3"><h2><span>Viper color</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">

It is the most beautiful <span>snake</span> that can be molded, because it
has very beautiful scales, &amp; hard &amp; transparent. Its true color
is made with good <m>verdigris</m>, well ground with some <m>good
vinegar</m>, if it is of <m>lead</m> or <m>tin</m>. And if it is in some
place darker, fumigate this first color with<m> sulphur</m>, as you
know. And if one needs to lighten and whiten, like under the throat, rub
with <span><m>coarse linen</m></span>. <add>The male, ejects from its
nature, which is at the bottom, when it is
firmly pressed, a little mass like <span>half an arquebus ball</span>,
made in the genitals and full of very venomous spurs.</add></div><div data-layout="left-middle">



<mark>+</mark> Put a bit of <m><span>metalline</span></m> in your
<m>tin</m> &amp; your <span>lizard</span> will resemble <m>silver</m>.</div></div><div id="p129r_4"><h2>Molded <span>roses</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">

They are awkward to mold because the petals are very fine &amp; weak
&amp; doubled. But, to <s><span>obl</span></s> avoid this, one needs to
anoint them with <m>wheat oil</m>, which is very dessicative. And having
quickly dried, it firms &amp; stiffens the leaves to be able to separate
them &amp; withstand the wet sand. The same is done with <span>flies</span>,
with <span>pansies</span>, &amp; similar delicate things, with flowers from
the <span>caper plant</span>.</div></div></folio></body></html>
