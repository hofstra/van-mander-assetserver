One ought to reheat for one or two <span><span>hours</span></span> <s><span>et
p</span></s>, in <add><s>that</s>a</add> <m>charcoal</m> fire which
lights by itself, a <span>crucible</span> with the substance inside, and
then blow &amp; cover the <span>crucible</span> with large <m>charcoals</m>
&amp; the mouth of the <span>furnace</span> with <span><m>bricks</m></span>, and
let it consume two or three feedings of <m>charcoal</m>, which
<s><span>se</span></s> fill the <span>furnace</span> above the
<span>crucible</span>. In the end feed and stoke the fire, &amp; when the
flame is very white &amp; that the substance will be in a liquid
<span>bain</span> like <m>water</m> &amp; casting off pale blue flames,
cast. The secret is to cast <add>very</add> hot &amp; in one go.</div></div><div id="p099r_2"><h2><m>Lean white sand</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">Without bond renders well proper for casting, &amp; having body, if
you grind it very finely on <span><m>porphyry</m></span> or calcine it,
reddening it several times in the fire, &amp; spread it in
<m>vinegar</m> or finely grind it with <m>water</m>, as you know. It
also molds very neatly in <span>noyau</span>, as I have experimented. But do
not moisten it with <m>salt water</m> if you want to promptly reheat it,
for <m>salt</m> boils on the fire &amp; makes pustules, being pressed by
the fire. I believe that the <span>noyau</span>, gently reheated, would not
do this. I molded very neatly in <span>noyau</span> the <m>substance of
skillets</m>. <m>White sand</m> <span>smells like <m>sulphur</m></span> when
reheated, and I believe it would melt. And since the substance has been
cast in it, it acquires in the <span>mold</span>
<s><span>co<exp>mm</exp>e</span></s> a luster as if it were
<m>leaded</m> or vitrified. I believe that <span>glassmakers</span> could
use it.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

They can be put back on, without remaking the bell, which one ought to
put back in the pit, &amp; and mold it there. But should you
<m>solder</m> a <s><span>ref</span></s> cracked bell, it is considered
impossible to give it its first voice.</div></div></folio></body></html>
