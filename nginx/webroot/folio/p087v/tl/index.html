neatly. Next, it is true that it often becomes porous, like <m>burned
earth</m> also does, like <m>fat sand</m> also does.</div><div data-layout="left-top">

I find that one ought not to knock on very finely ground sands, for it
shakes them loose, &amp; <s>make</s> prevents them from releasing
neatly. But one ought to press hard and moisten them sufficiently.</div></div><div id="p087v_2"><h2><m>Magistra</m></h2><div data-layout="middle"><span>Founders</span> take the <m>roots of a young <span>elm</span></m>
when it has sap, &amp; boil it in <m>wine</m>, or better yet
<m>vinegar</m>, and keep it <span>all year long</span> in a
<span>cask</span>.</div></div><div id="p087v_3"><h2><m>Sand from the <span>mine</span> of <span>Thoulouse</span></m></h2><div data-layout="middle"> Casting sand coming from the <span>mine</span>, once passed through a
<span>double sieve</span>, next put in with <m>melted resin</m>, burns &amp;
inflames &amp; becomes all red &amp; inflamed like <m>iron</m>. Once
cold it is completely black and can be ground very finely on
<span><m>porphyry</m></span>. Thus having prepared it &amp; rendered it
without asperity on the <span><span>fingernail</span></span>, I moistened it
with <m>beaten glair of egg</m> &amp; beat it well, until it was not pasty
but rather powdery. I found it of very good release, &amp; molded with
it in <m>lead</m> &amp; <m>tin</m> very neatly, but it wants to be well
reheated &amp; at ease.</div><div data-layout="middle">Others beat it well in a <span>mortar</span>, in small amounts at a
time, &amp; thus it is pressed together and rendered very fine. Then
they reheat it moderately, only to dry it. Next, they grind it dry on
<span><m>porphyry</m></span>. And thus it becomes as if impalpable, and not
too dried out, <s>it</s> and it retains body &amp; bond of the
<m>earth</m> to which it is related, and is better than when it is so
burnt. Once moistened with <m>glair of egg passed through a
<span>sponge</span></m>, it releases <s>very neatly <span>M</span></s> very
neatly in low relief, but not for figures in high relief. Therefore,
since then I have experimented <s><span>lexper</span></s> with
moistening it only with quite strong <m>vinegar</m>. It released a
figure which I could not release previously. And I believe that,
moistening the finest in a fashion as if with <m>glair</m> &amp; the
coarsest, for filling, with gushes of <m>salt water</m> or
<m>wine</m>, that they do not ally so well. Since they are of the same
nature &amp; are moistened the same, they embrace each other, &amp; hold
together one with the other.</div><div data-layout="middle">
<rub>To mold well</rub>, after having prepared your sands, mold <span>in
a day</span>. Slowly reheat them <span>the next day</span>, then cast them
on another.

</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

One ought to choose the one which is usually <s>as</s> in clods
&amp; lumps, well <span>deep in the earth</span>, for usually the one that
is found <span>above</span> has too much <m>earth</m>, and the deep one is
similar to <m>rock</m>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

I have molded with it in <m>pure lead</m> very <s>neatly</s> hot,
&amp; I had as an example the first very neat one, but the
<m>vinegar</m> hardly gives it any bond, &amp; thus it withstood only
one cast. </div></div></folio></body></html>
