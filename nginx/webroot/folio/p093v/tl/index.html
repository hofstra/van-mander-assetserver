have leisure to perfect the shadows &amp; touches on the face, one wets
the reverse of the face which is on <m>canvas</m> with a wet
<span>sponge</span>. Then, with a small <span><span>pinceau</span></span>, one makes
the shadows, which do not come undone. Next, one lays the flesh color,
which does not prevent the already painted shadows from appearing. And
again with a more lively flesh color, one touches the more prominent
areas. And with another <span><span>pinceau</span></span> one does the shadows
<add>again</add> by hatching. The shadow strokes do not come undone
because they are made of <m>bistre</m>, which stains the <m>canvas</m>
like <m>rust</m>. The said <m>bistre</m> is good <s>with</s> for
making shadows in <m>distemper</m> <s>mix</s>, for in <m>oil</m> it
has no body &amp; would not dry but with great difficulty. One mixes in
the said <m>bistre</m>, for shadow, <m><span>ocre de ru</span></m> &amp; a
little <m>sap green</m>. The best <m>bistre</m> is the greasy &amp;
shiny kind from the <span>fireplaces of large kitchens</span>. It is
difficult to grind &amp; screeches on the <span><m>marble</m></span>.</div></div><div id="p093v_2"><h2><m>Azure</m></h2><div data-layout="middle"><m><span>Azur dâ€™esmail</span></m> always wants to be cleaned because the
filth that can be seen in the <span>laveures</span> makes it die. One needs
to coat it two times, &amp; the first very thick, moving the
<span><span>pinceau</span></span> by laying it first lengthwise then across.
<figure></figure> It is better used on <m>canvas</m>, where it is imbibed
immediately, than on <m>wood</m>. <m>Varnish</m> returns it to its
vigor, because being imbibed, it becomes dark. To try it,
<span>painters</span> bring their <span>palette</span> to the
<span>grocers</span>, &amp; distemper &amp; alloy it with a little white
ground in <m>oil</m>, for in this way, the beautiful shows its
<span>turquine</span> vivacity, but the bad is lavender grey. The most
delicate is the best for working. It is thinned <s>working</s> by
washing it.</div></div><div id="p093v_3"><h2>Violet and <m>lake</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">It is made of <m>azure</m> &amp; <m>lake</m> which is also assayed
on the <span>palette</span> with white. It is deemed beautiful that which
which, on a <m>polished knife</m> or on <span><m>glass</m></span> gives a
clear <s>red</s> color of red rose, tending a little towards violet.
The kind which is <s>blac</s> dark red is not as pleasant.</div></div></folio></body></html>
