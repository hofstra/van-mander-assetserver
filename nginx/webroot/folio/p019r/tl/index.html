The <span>faulconneau</span> is loaded with a <span>ladle</span>, and one
commonly gives it only one <span><span>ladle</span></span>. There are also
other <span>faulconneaux</span> weighing three <span>quintals</span>, and which
are nine <span><span>pans</span></span> long. Their ball weighs half a
<span>lb</span>. Their charge is a quarter of <m>powder</m>. It is loaded
either with a <span>ladle</span>, but more commonly with a charge. At the
breech, 3 <span>balls</span>, &amp; 2 in front. To the small pieces which
are under 3 <span>quintals</span> one gives them at least 3 <span>balls</span>
&amp; a twelfth <span>part of a ball</span> at the breech, &amp; sometimes
takes away from the front to make this addition to the breech, according
to the length one gives them.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



The strength of the piece is at the level of the trunnion, which is the
point of departure of the lit <m>powder</m>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



The strength of the <span>berche</span> is at the
<span>maslée</span>, &amp;at the back of the
breech.

A double musket weighs 2 <span>quintal</span>s, is seven
<span><span>pan</span>s</span> long, carries a ball of a quarter of a
<span>lb</span> or a little less. At the breech 3 <span>balls</span>, two in
front. One loads it with as much <m>powder</m> as ball, up to the top of
the escutcheon, which in these small pieces can amount to <add>3
or</add> 4 <span>balls</span> of <m>arquebus powder</m>. For if one uses
<m>cannon powder</m>, one can load it to a thickness of <s>f</s>
five <span>balls</span>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



One needs to understand all of this as <m>iron</m> balls. When one
shoots a <m>metal</m> ball, one over-charges by a quarter
<span><span>ladle</span></span> because if a cannon ball weighs 40
<span>lb</span>, the <m>metal</m> one weighs lx <span>lb</span>. One also takes
the gun-sight higher when shooting a <m>metal</m> ball. For if one
shoots an <m>iron</m> ball point-blank, one takes six <span>lines</span>
higher when shooting <m>metal</m> balls. A <m>metal</m> ball <s>makes</s>
alloyed with <m>copper</m>, in order that it is not frangible, is more
effective hitting at close range than that of <m>iron</m>. But the
<m>iron</m> one hits more fiercely from afar. </div><div data-layout="middle">

A simple musket weighs one <span>quintal</span>, is six
<span><span>pan</span>s</span> long. <s>carries a ball weighing <span></span>
<span>qu</span></s> One has no consideration for those which are under two
<span>quintal</span>s, which readily carry <m>lead</m> balls
<s><span>un</span></s> of the weight of the ball, but of the caliber.
However, those which can receive balls of <m>metal</m> or <m>iron</m> do
better because they will penetrate more than six <m>lead</m> ones. Its
charge is up to the escutcheon, namely the thickness of 4
<span>balls</span>. </div><div data-layout="middle">

Arquebus à croc weighs lx <span>lb</span>, that is to say the large one is
five <span><span>pan</span>s</span> long, its charge is up to the
escutcheon, namely <add>the length of</add> 4 <span>balls</span>, it
carries <m>lead</m> balls, and is for the defence of houses. Of these
arquebus à croc, both the large &amp; the small ones, one makes orgues
which are <s>or</s> appropriate for an assault, both outside &amp;
inside the place. They are founded separately as if to serve for uses
other than orgues. See the marked 4th leaf following.
