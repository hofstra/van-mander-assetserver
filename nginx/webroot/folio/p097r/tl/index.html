file</span> such that there is nothing black
left on any of the guards, and next heats them,
&amp; passes them as is said. But to gild
&amp; gild with <m>silver</m>, they ought not to pass more than a little
beyond blue. Then while the guards are hot, one attaches them to a vice
&amp; with some <span>tweezers</span> one layers the <m>gold</m> &amp; one
sets it with <m>bloodstone</m>,which is quite clean &amp; rubbed with
<m><span>pott√©e</span></m>. And when the guards are cold, one reheats them,
then one layers the <m>gold</m> as above. And first one gives
<s>of</s> two layers, until the entire guard is well-garnished. And
next one reheats as at the beginning, &amp; one gives the third covering
of <m>gold</m>. Then one burnishes very thoroughly &amp; with great
force with a large <m>bloodstone</m>. <s>And</s> But note that
<add>to</add> burnish well, the guard always needs to be warm. And to
know this, <span>one smells it &amp; brings it close to the
<span>nose</span></span>. For one ought not to touch it with the
<span>fingers</span>, but one <s>holds it on</s> lifts it from on top of
the warm <m>ashes</m> with a small <span><m>iron</m> rod</span>, which has
been purposely made to go into the eye of the guard. And when it is
completely well-burnished, one rubs it very well with a <span><m>white
linen cloth</m></span>, and the <m>gold</m> needs to be thicker &amp;
stronger than for <span>painters</span>. A <span>quarter pound</span> is worth
fifty or LX <span>s<exp>ols</exp></span>.</div></div><div id="p097r_3"><h2>Gilding with <m>silver</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">One needs to prepare the guards &amp; whiten them with a
<s><span>lince </span></s> <span>file</span>, a little coarser
<s>for</s> than for <m>gold</m>. And one makes them pass beyond
grey, as for gilding. And when they are hot, one needs to double the
<m>silver foil</m>, then separate it with a <span>knife</span>, next apply
it to the guard, with <s><span>a small</span></s> <span>tweezers</span>
&amp; a small <span>burnisher</span>. And then reheat &amp; apply until they
are all gilt with <m>silver</m>. Next, one needs to cover them for the
third time, with the doubled foil as has been said, then burnish them
very well &amp; with force, not with the <m>bloodstone</m>, but with a
strong <span>burnisher</span>. Just as the <span>burnisher</span> ought not to
burnish <m>gold</m>.</div></div></folio></body></html>
