bizarre <m>thorn branch</m>, then melt a <span>lb</span> of the most
beautiful<m>clear pitch resin</m> and put in one <span>ounce</span> of
<m>subtly ground vermilion</m> with <m><span>walnut</span> oil</m>, and if
you add in a little <m><span>Venice</span> <span>laque platte</span></m>, the
color will be more vivid, and stir everything in the <m>resin</m> melted
over a <m>charcoal</m> fire and not of flame, for fear that the fire
catches within. Next dip in your branches while turning, &amp; if there
should remain any filaments, turn the branch over the heat of the
<m>charcoal</m>.</div><div data-layout="left-top" data-layout-hint="tall">





<m>Colophony</m> is nothing other than <m>resin</m> cooked again. To do
it well, take a <span><m>leaded</m> pot</span> &amp; melt the <m>resin</m>,
&amp; boil it over the <span>brazier</span> a good <span><span>hour</span></span>,
&amp; until it appears not to be thick, but clear &amp; liquid like
<m>water</m> &amp; it easily runs &amp; flows from the tip of a
<span>stick</span> with which you grind it, &amp; try it. Then pour it
through a <span><m>coarse canvas</m></span> or a <span><m>very light tammy
cloth</m></span>, in the manner that when pouring it falls into the
strongest <m>vinegar</m> that you can find, for the <m>vinegar</m> gives
it strength &amp; prevents it from being so fragile. Reiterate this two
or three times &amp; it will be beautiful &amp; well purified. For
counterfeiting your <m>coral</m>, you can mix a <span>quarter part</span> of
<m>mastic</m> within your <m>purified resin</m> to render it more firm
and more beautiful, &amp; if you should take only a tear of
<m>mastic</m>, it would be all the better, but it would be too long.

<m>Sulfur</m> &amp; <m>vermilion</m> makes the same effect.</div><div data-layout="top">

The <m>coral</m> made of <m>gules red enamel</m> endures the
<span>file</span> and polishing.</div><div data-layout="right-top">

It is made like <m>cement</m> that is stronger mixed with <m><span>pestled</span>
<s>than of</s> glass</m> rather than with <m>brick</m>. Thus one
mixes here with the <m>vermilion</m> the <m>gules red enamel</m>, which
is red in body, well <m>pestled</m>. Thus with all colors of
<m>enamels</m>.</div></div><div id="p003r_2"><h2><m>Varnish</m> for panels</h2><div data-layout="middle">Take a <span>lb</span> of <m><span>Venice</span> turpentine</m> &amp; heat
it in a <span>pot</span> until it simmers, and put in half a <span>lb</span> of
the <m>turpentine oil</m> of the whitest you can find, and stir it all
together well on a <m>charcoal</m> fire and take it off immediately. And
<s><span>elle</span></s> it is done. But if it seems too thick to you,
add in a little more <m>oil</m>. Similarly if it is too clear, you can
thicken it by putting a little <m>turpentine</m>. Thus you will give it
whatever body you want. It could be made well without fire, but, when
heated, it is more desiccative. It is appropriate for panel paintings
and other painted things without distorting the colors or yellowing. And
it dries both <span>in the shade</span> and <span>in the sun</span>, and
<span>overnight</span>, and <span>during the winter</span> as well as
<span>in the summer</span>. It is commonly sold 15 <span>sols</span> a
<span>lb</span>.</div><div data-layout="left-bottom" data-layout-hint="tall">




A little more <m>turpentine</m> than <m>turpentine oil</m> is needed in
order to give body to the <m>varnish</m>, which needs to be applied with
the <span><span>finger</span></span> in order to spread it thinner and less thick,
for when it is thick, it turns yellow and sticks. One does not
<m>varnish</m> to make paintings shine, for it just takes the light out
of them.</div><div data-layout="left-bottom" data-layout-hint="wide">



But it is used to enhance colors which have soaked in and to keep them
from dust. <m>Mastic varnish</m> does not resist <span>rain</span>,
whereas that of <m>oil</m> and <m>rosin</m> does.</div></div><div id="p003r_3"><h2><m>Thick varnish</m> for planks</h2><div data-layout="middle">There is a <m>varnish</m> that takes a long time to dry &amp; still
drips up to two <span>months</span> after it has been applied to the
planks. But this one does not drip like the one used <span>in the
past</span>, which was made of <m>linseed oil</m> boiled with
<m>garlic</m>, to extinguish it &amp; take
out the fattiness, &amp; with <m>wheat</m>. And this one yellowed &amp;
made the blue color of paintings greenish. This one is made like the
other one except that one puts <m>coarse common turpentine</m></div><div><i>Continued...</i></div></div></folio></body></html>
