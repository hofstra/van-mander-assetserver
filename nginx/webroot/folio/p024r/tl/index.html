there is <m>fine metal</m> and <m>crude metal</m>. <m>Fine
metal</m> is that of a large bell, because one
puts in more <m>copper</m> to give it a bigger voice, &amp; for small
bells one puts more <m>tin</m> to give it a <s>bigger</s> clearer
sound. The <m>metal of a large bell</m> is made with <s>one</s>
<add>3</add> quintal<add>s</add> of <m>rosette</m> &amp; twenty or xxv
<span>lb</span> of <m>tin</m>. <s><span>Tan</span></s> Each grenade must
weigh four to six <span>lb</span>. In order to throw them, it is necessary
that they be full of <m>powder</m> mixed with <m>coarsely <span>pestled</span>
glass</m>. And for a quarter <span>lb</span> of <m>powder</m>, one needs
half an <span>ounce</span> of <m>glass</m> which is put with it, in order
that on the face or places where the <m>powder</m> will have its effect,
the <span>wounds</span> will be all the worse for it. The <m>best arquebus
powder</m> is required here. The hole needs to be as large as <span>the
thickness of a <span>swan</span>'s quill</span>, &amp; you need not bother to
make it threaded, but it is enough to make it even. Next, you make a
<add>well-soldered</add> pipe of <m>fer
blanc</m>, which can enter into the hole &amp; enter into the middle of
the grenade &amp; which comes out of it <span>by the width of one
<span>finger</span></span>. You will fill it with <m>good powder</m>, <span>pestled</span>
in a <span>mortar</span> &amp; lightly mixed with <m>good eau-de-vie</m> or
<m>strong vinegar</m> <s>which seems. And when</s> This is done to
temper the <m>powder</m>. And to know if it will be slow enough to allow
leisure to throw the grenade without danger, try this <m>powder</m> thus
bathed in another pipe. You can keep <s><span>d</span></s> your loaded
grenades in a <span>very dry place</span>, &amp; on the contrary you shall
keep your pipes filled with that bathed and well-compressed
<m>powder</m> in a <span>humid place</span>. And nonetheless, you shall
have some already inserted into <s>the</s> <add>some</add> grenades,
to be always provisioned. And <span>every three days</span> you shall
change them if you recognise that they have become too dry. To throw
your grenade, take it bravely <s>&amp;</s> in one <span>hand</span>
&amp; with the other give fire to your pipe with <s>the</s> a
match , &amp; throw it promptly amidst the
<s>powder</s> troops. The thickness of the
grenade should be <span>twice the back edge of
a knife</span>.<br>
