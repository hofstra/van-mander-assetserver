delicate &amp; fine, it is necessary that the <m>tin</m> exceeds
<m>lead</m> in the mixture &amp; on the contrary, if it is thick, it is
necessary that <m>lead</m> exceed. Therefore for the <s>mixture</s>
fine thing, put in some <m>fine tin</m>, not all the <span>quarter
part</span> of <m>lead</m>. And make sure that your <span>mold</span> is
<span>hottish, such that you can hold it in your
<span><span>hand</span></span></span>, when you want to cast. As for the
<m>alloyed tin</m>, the same as mentioned, it is necessary that it is
very hot &amp; almost red for casting, so that it penetrates. Otherwise,
having <add><span>a</span></add> to run the length of the fine branches of
the plant, it will get cold before arriving there. And do not forget to
mix in it a little <m>looking-glass tin</m>, which makes it run better
&amp; firms it up.</div><div data-layout="left-top">

In the <m>lead alloyed with tin</m>, or <m>tin alloyed with lead</m>,
you can put a little bit of <m><span>metalline</span></m> &amp; it will seem
<m>silver</m>. But do not put too much, for this hardens the substance
&amp; sours it also, so that for a delicate thing like legs &amp;
similar things, it would not be appropriate.</div></div><div id="p115v_2"><h2>For giving vent to the <span>mold</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">In addition to your vents, if your <s><span>es</span></s> plant is
very fine, you can pass a <span>thread</span> through the
<add><m>clay</m></add> circle, rather than casting with a
<span>needle</span>, &amp; make sure it passes through the plant. And with
<span>thread</span>, burning like the plant, a hole will remain, which will
give air &amp; venting, to help clean.</div></div><div id="p115v_3"><h2>Reheating the <span><span>noyau</span> molds</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">After your <span>molds</span> have their gate, vents &amp;
<span>clamps</span>, as mentioned, make at the end of the <span>forge</span>
<s><span>en</span></s>, or in some clean place, a surrounding of
<m>bricks</m>, and fill it with large half-lit charcoal. And place your
<span>molds</span> on top, and leave the charcoals thus to light by
themselves for a <span><span>half hour</span></span>, so that they heat little
by little and not all at once. Finally as they begin to become white,
beat <s><span>little by little</span></s> the thus half-lit large charcoals
on top &amp; blow with your <span>little bellows</span>, until they are
warmed. And thus, little <add>by little</add>, invigorate the fire,
without haste, until you <span>mold</span>s are well red on the outside
&amp; the inside. If it is for casting some plant or some animal which
does not release well &amp; in this case, one needs to burn
<add>it</add> in the <span>mold</span> &amp; when you look through the gate
&amp; through it you see the <span>molds</span> are very red &amp; inflamed
inside, this will be your signal that they are reheated enough. But if
you do not see this signal, increase &amp;continue the fire until it is
the case. If there is nothing in the <span>mold</span> that needs burning,
it will be enough that they are dried well on the same fire, if it is
for casting <m>tin</m>, they reheat better in a <span>reverberatory
furnace</span>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">
figure/&gt;
Do not pull out your <span>reheated molds</span> from the fire, before they
have cooled themselves &amp; take care that neither the <span>wind or the
cold</span> hits them while very hot, for this would make them burst. One
must not reheat them before they are dry and firmed up for they would
cast in a different way, and it is necessary beforehand to make gates
&amp; vents &amp; place <span>clamps</span>.</div><div data-layout="left-bottom">

Take care not to heat the fire in one go, for fear <s><span>f</span></s>
that your <span>molds</span> crack inside.</div><div data-layout="left-bottom">

They are reheated enough when the entire hole of the gate is red. When
it is black, it is not enough.</div><div data-layout="left-bottom">

For casting in <m>silver</m>, one must not reheat two times
<s>&amp;</s>, if there is nothing in the <span>mold</span> that needs
<s><span>despouiller</span></s> burning, simply because it does not
release well. All the <span>molds of <span>farriers</span></span> are reheated
two times, first for <figure></figure></div><div><i>Continued...</i></div></div></folio></body></html>
