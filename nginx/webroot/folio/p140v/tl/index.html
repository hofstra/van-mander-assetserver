etch on <m>silver</m> &amp; <m>copper</m> with <m>aquafortis</m>. With
this also, one takes the hollow of the relief &amp; then one throws in
this hollow some wet sand, which immediately represents the relief very
neatly. And then, you can cast on this one, the hollow of this one in
<m>copper</m>, <m>gold</m> and <m>silver</m>, and make seals of great
singularity.</div><div data-layout="middle">

To cast neatly in <m>sulfur</m>, arrange the <m>bread pith</m> under the
<span>brazier</span>, as you know. Mold in it what you want &amp; let dry
&amp; you will have very neat work.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">


Try <m>sulfur</m> passed through <m>melted wax</m>, because it no longer
inflames &amp; and no longer makes eyelets.</div></div><div id="p140v_2"><h2>Molding and shrinking a large figure</h2><div data-layout="middle">

Mold it with <m>bread pith</m>, having come from the <span>oven</span>, or
as the above, &amp; in drying out it will shrink &amp; consequently the
medal that you will cast. You <s>it</s> can, by this means, by
elongating and widening the imprinted <m>bread pith</m>, vary the figure
&amp; with one image make many various ones. <m>Bread</m> coming from
the <span>oven</span> is better. And the one that is reheated twice retracts
more. You can cast <m>sulphur</m> without leaving the imprint of the
<m>bread</m> to dry, if you want to mold as big as it is. But if you
want to let it shrink, make it dry, either more or less.</div></div><div id="p140v_3"><h2>Cast of <m>lead</m> and <m>tin</m> in <m>plaster</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">

If you want to cast some flat medal or some animal that is not very
weighty, and that does not need to burn in the <span>mold</span>, you can
cast in <m>plaster</m> &amp; <m>brick</m> mixed like above, and not in
<m>plaster</m> alone, for it contracts too much, feeling a harsh fire if
it does not have a companion. But, with <m>brick</m>, it holds well.
However, take heed to dry out your <span>mold</span> at length &amp; on a
slow fire &amp; with patience, for there is no need to reheat it. But
when your work is of <m>flowers</m> or other things that want <s>to
be</s> their <span>molds</span> reheated &amp; set ablaze, mix in some
<m><span>alum de plume</span></m> &amp; even some <m><span>crocum</span></m>. I have
molded in <m>plaster</m> &amp; <m>brick</m> very neatly &amp; it
withstood several castings.</div><div data-layout="left-top" data-layout-hint="tall">




<man>I tried</man> <m>plaster</m> &amp;
<m>brick</m> alone and molded <span>en noyau</span> like others. My
<span>mold</span> was very neat, having lightly <m>oiled</m> &amp; rubbed
with <m>eau-de-vie</m> my medal. I made my gate ample at the entrance,
narrowing it until the medal, which was very thin. I notched the gate
which embraced well the medal. I dried the <span>mold</span> well on a slow
fire &amp; at the end, heated it well without reddening it. I let it
<span>cool in such a way that <span>I could hold my <span><span>finger</span></span>
to it without burning myself</span></span>. I made an alloy of 4
<span>℥</span> of <m>tin</m>, &amp; six
<span><span>deniers</span></span> of <m>lead</m>. I cast red, and it came out
well. Next, I put in for 4 <span>℥</span> of
<m>tin</m> xii <span><span>deniers</span></span> of <m>lead</m>, it came out
very well.</div><div data-layout="left-top">


When there is nothing to burn in the mold, it is not necessary to reheat
it for <m>lead</m> &amp; <m>tin</m>. But for flowers &amp; what should
burn, yes.</div></div></folio></body></html>
