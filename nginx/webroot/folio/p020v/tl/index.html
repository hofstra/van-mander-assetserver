other, &amp; wash with this <m>whitened water</m>. This is considered
quite exquisit. And I believe that making it from <m><span>wheat</span>
starch</m> &amp; to use it would be even better.</div></div><div id="p020v_2"><h2>Against winds, colic, &amp;c.</h2><div data-layout="middle"><m>Sap squeezed or water <s><span></span></s> distilled from
<span>orange</span> peel</m> is excellent against the windy colic.
<m>Candied peel</m>, too, is excellent for the winds of the
<span>belly</span>. And to make a trial of it, having poured <m>foaming
wine</m> in a <span><m>glass</m></span>, squeeze <m><span>orange</span>
juice</m> on the <m>wine foam</m>, which proceeds only from vapor &amp;
wind, and you will see that the foam will immediately disappear. Also,
if you squeeze <m>juice</m> against a <span>candle</span> it will burn all
the brighter.

<span>puys rodier</span> or fountain one can water it often</span>, for by
this means they are tender. Otherwise they make a hard heart inside,
which takes from it all its goodness.

to soak like this, then apply it.

Or else, apply <m>black soap</m> on the burn. Experimented.

bells of <span>Mende</span>. However, one holds the <corr>bell</corr> of
<span>Toulouse</span> named Cardaillac as one of the most beautiful in
<span>France</span>, all the more since it weighs two hundred and fifty
<span><span>quintals</span></span>.

</div></div><div id="p020v_6"><h2>A form of regimen</h2><div data-layout="middle"><span>Every morning</span>, take two or three <m>eggs</m> laid one or
two <span>days</span> ago. Heat them <s>until</s> &amp; do not cook
them. Take the <m>yolks</m> well dusted with <m>sugar</m>. And next
drink one <span><span>finger</span></span> of <m>wine</m>. And apart from being
nourishing, it makes a good <span>stomach</span>.
