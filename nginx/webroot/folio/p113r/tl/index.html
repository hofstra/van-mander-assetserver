take it out if you need to. And take heed that it is necessary that
these <span>points</span> be of the most delicate <m>iron wire</m> possible
to bear the size of the animals. For, the more delicate it is, the
smaller the hole that it leaves appears. However, one needs 
different thicknesses of these, because <s><span>il</span></s>
<s><span>de</span></s> the <span>points</span> which are put in the body
&amp; in thicker places, like under the throat, ought to be longer &amp;
stronger than the ones of the legs &amp; thin parts, where the
<span>needles</span> ought to be subtle &amp; delicate, as it were like the
biggest <m>strings of <span>spinets</span></m>. And it is better that they
be of <m>iron wire</m>, which is firmer than <m>the one of latten</m>.
And if the end of the tail, or the end of a nail or a leg ought to be
joined to the body, do not put the <span>point</span> there, not to corrupt
it. But place <m>wax</m>, <span>as much as a <m>grain of
<span>millet</span></m></span>, between the body &amp; <s><span>ce</span></s>
<s><span>qui</span></s> the end of the tail, then with a bit of
flattened &amp; hot <m>iron wire</m>, touch this <m>wax</m> &amp; join
by lightly pressing. Thus having placed your animal on the
<span>tourtelle</span> shaped like a <span>mandore</span>, place all around a
circle of the same

big <span>knife</span>, with which you have cut your <span>tourtelle</span> to
the right size, pare the outside which exceeds it, &amp; place there a
piece to close it as you see in b. Then, with a <span>small curved
instrument</span>, mark on the inside of the circle the thickness you want
to give to the <span>mold</span>, which will be for a <span>common snake</span>
as thick as two <span><span><span>poulces</span></span></span>, in order that when you
throw in your wet sand, you will see when it is thick enough. All of
this carefully arranged, moisten well everywhere with good <m>eau-de-vie</m> with a <span><span>pinceau</span></span> the body of the animal
which is uncovered. For this the secret <s><span>de la plus</span></s>
kept well hidden, because everything that is <s><span>v</span></s>
touched by <m>eau-de-vie</m> will undoubtedly come out very
neatly &amp; without <s>bubbles</s> any <span>small eyes or holes</span>
that we call bubbles, which usually come not at the back &amp; in the
thick sides of the <span>mold</span>, but on the edges. And as soon as you
have thus moistened everything with <m>eau-de-vie</m>, throw
in your wet sand without letting the <m>eau-de-vie</m> dry,
which evaporates promptly. And wet it thus.</div><div data-layout="left-top">

and make sure that the <span>point</span> is long according to the height
you want the head, and that it be pointed on both ends. Once placed
thus, plant your <span>snake</span> on the slab of <m>earth</m>, &amp;
arrange the head first and then the rest.

If after you have placed you animal on your <m>clay</m>

it is on top of the animal, clean it very carefully and touch it
