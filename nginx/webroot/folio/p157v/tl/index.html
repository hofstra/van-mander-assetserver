<m>ashes</m> go out. For when the <span>mold</span> is hot, they adhere
against it &amp; once cold, they separate from it more easily, &amp; go
out from it by blowing with air <span>en vapeur</span>.</div></div><div id="p157v_2"><h2>Molding a <span>bird</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">One needs to give it its shape. And to do this, place it on its side
on a <span><m>clay</m> slab</span>, and hide &amp; sink within it half the
aforesaid <span>bird</span>, <add>in order</add> that it only shows one leg
&amp; one foot, then you will anoint it with <m>butter</m> to make it
hold the feathers down, finally <s>of<m>oil</m></s>
<m>eau-de-vie</m>. And then cast. And having made this take, clean &amp;
uncover whatever needs it. Next, mold the other side in the same way. But
because the feet, being of <m>bone</m> that is difficult to burn, &amp;
are not able to be cleaned with either by <m>quicksilver</m>
<s>If</s> or by any other means, if the <span>mold</span> would not
open, uncover the bottom of the feet &amp; the toe or the little finger
of the claw, &amp; mold as a separate piece. Reheat &amp; open your
<span>mold</span> &amp; clean the <m>bones</m>. The feet usually remain too
weak to support the mass of a <span>solid bird</span>. And for this reason
one applies an <span><m>iron thread</m></span> in the <span>mold</span> of the
feet, which passes into the body before casting, thus they are
reinforced. Some mold the wings in a <span>frame</span>. Others mold the
head &amp;the said wings separately <span>en noyau</span>, then join &amp;
repair them, to first rough out a form that will be rigid &amp;
withstand the wet sand.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

They are skinned &amp; filled with <span><m>cotton cloth</m></span>. &amp;
even better, one needs to dress them in the fashion that <span>curriers</span>
do, in order that they do not lose a <m>feather</m>, weight it. The
dressing is <m>alum</m> &amp; <m>paste of flour</m>.</div></div><div id="p157v_3"><h2>For making <span>h</span><exp>…</exp> wine
