is the most excellent sand one can find for molding in a <span>frame</span>,
because it is appropriate for <m>silver</m> &amp; for <m>gold</m>, &amp;
the more you use it and the older it is, the better it is. One molds in
it very thinly &amp; finely.</div></div><div id="p106r_2"><h2><add>Making <m>gold</m> run</add> for casting</h2><div data-layout="middle">Because <m>gold</m> cools down very quickly, one ought to give it a
mix when <s>melted <span>q</span></s> it is well melted which maintains
the heat. <m>Sublimate</m> softens it nicely. But, because it goes up in
smoke, it does not continue to help. Therefore mix this composition when
you want to cast: <m>sal ammoniac</m>, the best <m><span>verdet</span></m>
that you can find, a little <m>borax</m> &amp; <m>saltpeter</m>
<s><add><span>qui li</span></add></s>. And this, by keeping it warm, it
will come out neatly. <add><m>Saltpeter</m> clarifies it &amp;
<s><span>p</span></s> heats it. But the most important thing in this
mixture is the <m><span>verdet</span></m>, which has to be good. This
mixture softens the <m>gold</m> <s><span>qui</span></s> so much that it
becomes treatable like <m>lead</m>, even <m>fine gold</m>.</add></div><div data-layout="middle">For sand for molding flowers &amp; leaves &amp; delicate things, mix
in <m>well-ground raw plaster</m>, <m>brick</m> &amp; <m><span>alum de
plume</span></m>.</div><div data-layout="middle">To moisten sands, <m>eau-de-vie</m> is excellent, for it
grinds the sand finely &amp; evaporates <s><span>que</span></s> when one
reheats the <span>frames</span>.</div><div data-layout="middle"><m>Sal ammoniac water</m> is very good, is excellent for moistening
sands, but for lots of <m>water</m> one only needs a little <m>sal
ammoniac</m>.</div><div data-layout="middle">A loop of <m>iron</m>, for lack of <m><span>crocum ferri</span></m>, is
<s><span>exce</span></s> good for <m>gold</m>.</div><div data-layout="middle">The <span>snakes</span> or <span>lizards</span> you want to mold should not
be kept for a <span>long time</span>, for if they are alive, they get
thin, and if they are <s>dry <span>il</span></s> dead, they wither.</div><div data-layout="middle"><m>Plaster of <span>Paris</span></m> is as firm as <m>stone</m> &amp;
very good. When you will want to choose some for your sand, take it raw,
the hardest possible &amp; which does not make any powder. The
transparent one and the one that thus makes powder retracts,
<s><span>Ce</span></s> which is not good for this work. A sign of the
one that is close to perfection is that it is hard &amp; made of
lustrous grains nearing the shape of <m>sugar</m>. Finally, to mix some
into the sand to cast <m>gold</m>, it is necessary that it endures the
fire twice, &amp; is reheated twice.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

<mark>+</mark> When <m>gold</m> is very fine, it is so dry that it
can hardly endure a <span>hammer</span>, but this mixture softens it like
<m>lead</m>.</div></div></folio></body></html>
