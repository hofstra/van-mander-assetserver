<m>well-made glass</m> is made of <m><span>fern</span> ashes</m> &amp;
<m>pebbles</m>, and first they blow up a long bubble, which another
<span>worker</span>, with long shears, cleaves &amp; cuts lengthwise.
Then, having set this long, cleft bubble on a <span><m>stone</m></span> or
large <span>platine</span> that is in the <span>furnace</span>, a little less
warm than the <span>fonte</span>, it is left to expand. And again in
addition to this, they flatten it with a long &amp; <span>thick round
<m>iron</m> stick</span>, then they put it back in the <span>furnace</span> to
reheat. It is made in the same way in <span>England</span> more beautifully.

from <span>Lorraine</span>. That of plate is blown in a long still, which
someone else cuts at the tip, then the blower, while turning it &amp;
while touching it to a <span>plane</span> that is on the ground,
<s><span>A</span></s> flattens it, then puts it to reheat. Thus the
middle where it begins still remains.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">
