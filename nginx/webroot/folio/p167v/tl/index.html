Those of 27 lb or thereabouts are ix <span>inches</span> long &amp; six in
diameter at the muzzle. At the breech, they are vi <span>lines</span> thick,
&amp; 3 at the muzzle. The ones weighing 17 <span>lb</span> are 8
<span>inches</span> long &amp; five at the muzzle. One covers them all
together, all the <span>forks</span> &amp; <span>pegs</span> &amp;
<span>tools</span> which one uses, with a <span>thick canvas</span> or <span>thick
cloth</span> in order that they do not make any noise. It
<s><span>s</span></s> is good that they should sit loaded for some time.
After one has put the <m>powder</m> in, one tamps it down quite
thoroughly, and then one puts in <m>pressed paper</m>, then a <m>cake of
wax</m> well tamped down, &amp; on the <m>wax</m> another <m>plate of
cork</m> that goes in quite precisely &amp; with force. In this way,
the <m>powder</m> remains well sealed &amp; gives much greater violence,
&amp; if you wish, you can put on the <m>plate of cork</m> one of
<m>wood</m> pierced in the middle, if the petard is pierced at the
breech, which one holds to be the easiest &amp; which makes for greater
penetration because it cannot recoil. And for those that have a pierced
breech, one must have a good <span>gimlet</span> to first make the hole in
order that the <span>peg</span>, which is made <s>in</s> with a
<span>gimlet</span>-like point, may attach the petard faster &amp; without
noise. And <s>to</s> for these, one must cover the button, which is
quite evenly filed, <s><span>p</span></s> with <m>waxed canvas</m>, or
add <m>wax</m> to it in order that it precisely plugs the hole of the
breech. But because the doors are sometimes iron-clad &amp; the
<span><m>iron</m> pegs</span> cannot pierce it, one uses an <span><m>iron</m>
fork made like pincers</span> &amp; another <span><m>iron</m> rod
<s><span>q</span></s> made with three claws at the end</span>, as you see
depicted. And in this way, the petard holds itself well &amp; is quickly
placed. The <span><m>iron</m> pegs</span> must extend from the petard with
the entire point that is made like a <span>gimlet</span>, namely by three or
4 <span><span>fingers</span></span>, which goes entirely <s><span>l</span></s>
into the door. When the petards are placed, one fills the touch-hole
with good <m><span>pulverin</span></m> and
<s><span>s</span></s> one puts in it a <m>feather quill</m> filled with
<m>powder</m> tightly pressed &amp; moistened with <m>vinegar</m>, or,
if needed, one presses the <m>powder</m> in the hollow of the hand &amp;
having wetted it with <m><span>saliva</span></m>, one makes from it
something like a cocoon or</div><div><i>Continued...</i></div></div></folio></body></html>
