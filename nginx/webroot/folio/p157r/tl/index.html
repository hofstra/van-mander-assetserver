They mold in two <span><m><span>cuttlefish</span> bones</m></span> their animal
or other work that they have either already made, or modelled in
<m>wax</m> &amp; cast in <m>lead</m>. Since it is well imprinted in the
two <span><m><span>cuttlefish</span> bones</m></span>, they place between these
two <span><m>bones</m></span> a <span><m>paper</m></span>, &amp; join the
<span><m>bones</m></span> &amp; cast. The work comes out split in half. And
then, with <s><span>ch</span></s> a <span><span>chaple</span></span>, they
hollow out as finely as they please the two halves cast in <m>gold</m>
or <m>silver</m>, and then <m>solder</m> or braze them.</div></div><div id="p157r_2"><h2><m>Rouge clair</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">

Some <span>goldsmiths</span> assay it on <m>thinly beaten
<s><span>esp</span></s> gold</m> &amp; that is well burnished with a
<span><span>chaple</span></span>. But it is better to assay it on a <m>gold
ingot</m>. And also assay your substances in large or fantastical work,
since if they appear good &amp; extraordinary in large work, they will
show excellently on a common work.</div></div><div id="p157r_3"><h2>Cleaning and degreasing your works cast from <m>tin</m> and
others</h2><div data-layout="middle">Make some <m>lye</m>, carefully passed through <m>good ashes</m>,
and since it is recent &amp; not fatty, boil your molded work in it. And
the <m>tallow</m> and <m>fat</m> leaves it.</div></div><div id="p157r_4"><h2>Arranging plants or flowers for casting</h2><div data-layout="middle">

Always put on the top the principal side of the thing, because it comes
out better and neater than the bottom. Make the gate wide &amp; make sure that
<sup>there is</sup> <span><span>supraplus</span></span> (which is the
<span>masse</span> for <span>founders</span>) for a large gate,
<s><span>Et</span></s> especially for <m>silver</m>, which wants the
<span>mold</span> quite hot &amp; to be cast very hot. Very thin things want
to be cast very hot.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

When you know that the stem of a flower, burned in a <span>mold</span> which
does not open, is reduced well into <m>ashes</m>, it is a sign that the
rest is well burned.</div></div><div id="p157r_5"><h2><span>Flies</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">They mold better on a single leaf than <s><span>n</span></s> on a
bouquet or a flower or the branch of a plant, because the single leaf
molds in two halves, which, once reheated can open and clean well &amp;
the cast is made better. Take heed when using the <span>fly</span> to not
break the legs &amp; to not let it dry too much, for then the legs fall
off. And if this happens to you, <m>glue</m> with <m><span>fish</span>
glue</m> the same legs and with <m>wax</m>, or fashion some out of
<m><span>pork</span> hair</m> or <m><span>spinet</span> string</m>. Fix the leaf
on the <span><m>clay</m> slab</span> with two <span>points</span>, and the
<span>fly</span> with one <span>point</span> in the middle of the body, &amp;
the legs with some <m>wax</m>.</div></div></folio></body></html>
