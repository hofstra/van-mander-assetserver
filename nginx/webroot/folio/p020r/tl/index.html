<m>husks</m> and then you will clean it well. Next one needs to
grind it again quite finely and pass it through a <span>hair sieve</span>
quite finely. This done, it is necessary to mix the <m>flour</m> with
<m>melted fresh butter</m> and some <m>milk</m>, and that there be
<span>as much of one as the other</span>, in such a manner that it is very light in color,
like the <m>dough to make fritters</m>. And you will put in <m>egg
yolks</m> according to the quantity of <m>flour</m>, so that it amounts
to two <m>egg <corr>yolks</corr></m> for each <m><span>millas</span></m>.
Then you will put in some <m><span>saffron</span></m>, if you like, to give
them a little color.</div><div data-layout="middle">Next, you need to have your <span>molds</span>, and it is
necessary that they be <m>earthenware</m>, in the fashion of the crown of
a catholic hat, but it is necessary that they be open at both ends. And
then, having made a good fire, you will clean the place in the
<span><span>hearth</span></span> where you want to put your
<m><span>millas</span></m>, and then you will take your <span>molds</span> and
grease them quite heavily in order that the <m>dough</m> does not stick when
cooked. Having done that, you will put your said <span>molds</span> on the
well-cleaned place in the <span><span>hearth</span></span> and will put a
little <m>flour</m> at the bottom and fill them with the aforementioned
<m>dough</m>. Next you will cover the said <span>molds</span> with
<span>lids</span> which will be made like the <span>molds</span>, but it is
necessary that they be larger and not be open at the top. Then having
done that, you will put a little <m>hay</m> on the said <span>lids</span>
and plenty of <span>embers</span>, and make a good charcoal fire all around.
That done, you will uncover one of them soon thereafter and see when it
is cooked. It should be hard.</div></div><div id="p020r_2"><h2>@<span>Glassworker</span></h2><div data-layout="middle"><m>Glass from <span>Lorraine</span></m> is smoother &amp; more even than
<m>plate glass</m> and it is sturdier &amp; more durable. But commonly
it is stained by veins, in straight lines as if tanned, which happens
because the <span>glassmakers</span>, having made it, put it when totally
hot on <m><span>straw</span></m>, which stains it in this way. However, this
is removed with <m>varnish</m> &amp; <m>salt</m> &amp; other
<m>drugs</m> that the <span>glassworkers</span> put on. <m>Glass from <span>Lorraine</span></m> is sold by the <span>bundle</span> &amp; each
<span><span>bundle</span></span> is composed of three <span>tablets</span>.
The <span>bundle</span> costs usually x <span><span>sous</span></span>.
<m>Plate glass</m> <s>sold in</s> is made in <span>France</span>, it is
whiter &amp; clearer, but alternately it is not so durable as that from
<span>Lorraine</span>. It is also commonly blown &amp; in that case, it is
better to make little diamonds rather than large square pieces in the
shape of a frame, because they are not able to seat themselves very
evenly.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

<m>Plate glass</m> is sold by <span><span>paniers</span></span>. Every
<span><span><span>panier</span></span></span> contains 24 <span>plates</span> that are
commonly sold at x or twelve <span>lb</span>.</div></div></folio></body></html>
