<ab>Take <m>white arsenic</m>, two <ms>ounces</ms>, 2
<ms>℥</ms>

<m>Orpiment</m> or <m>yellow arsenic</m>, two <ms>ounces</ms>, 2
<ms>℥</ms>

<m><la>Aes ustum</la></m>, two <ms>ounces</ms>, 2
<ms>℥</ms>

<m><add>Fine</add> copper filings</m> moderately ground, 2
<ms>℥</ms>

<m>Antimony</m>, 2 <ms>℥</ms>

<m>Rock salt</m>, 2 <ms>℥</ms>

<m>Raw Tartar</m>, 2 <ms>℥</ms>

<m>Sandever</m>, 2 <ms>℥</ms>

<m>Saltpeter</m>, <ms>half</ms> that is to say 1
<ms>℥</ms>

<m>Coarse common salt <add>melted</add></m>, <ms>half</ms>, 1
<ms>℥</ms>

<m>Sublimate</m>, <ms>half</ms>, 1 <ms>℥</ms>

<m>Borax</m>, <ms>half</ms>, 1 <ms>℥</ms>

<m>Sal ammoniac</m>, <ms>as much as <m>borax</m></ms>, that is to say 1
<ms>℥</ms></ab>

<ab>Take these substances, of the best kind you can find. Weigh them as
said above, and pestle them separately, keeping your
<bp><bp>face</bp></bp> covered, over the <bp>nose</bp> &amp; the
<bp>mouth</bp>, from the <bp>eyes</bp> down, to avoid the exhalations of
<m>arsenic</m>, <m>sublimate</m>, and <m>orpiment</m>. Mix them well all
together, then put them in a <tl>good crucible</tl> that is so large
that the substances can have space of the <ms>fourth or fifth part</ms>.
Cover the <tl>crucible</tl> with a <tl>good tile</tl>, adapted in a
circle precisely on its opening. And having bound it from top to bottom
and on the sides with <tl><m>iron wire</m></tl> quite strongly, <m>lute</m> it
with <m>earth mixed with dung or founder’s earth, that <pro>artillery
founders</pro> use</m>. And in this, be careful &amp; diligent, &amp; do
not forget to mix in <m><tl>pestled</tl> glass</m> throughout the <m>lute</m> to
fortify your <tl>crucible</tl>, in such a manner that it takes no air, for the
substance would be worth little, because the <del>4</del>
<add>five</add> last ingredients would be exhaled. </ab>

<ab>
<margin>right-top</margin>
Note that you need to <m>lute</m> well your <tl>crucible</tl>, in order that the
substances do not take air, for they would be exhaled.</ab>

<ab>
<margin>right-middle</margin>

<m>Lute</m>well your <tl>crucible</tl>, in order that it does not break. For
if it breaks, the substances evaporate &amp; the <md>fumes in it are
dangerous</md>. If within 12 <ms><tmp>hours</tmp></ms> it is not melted
and mixed, it will not be well made. </ab>

<pro>Goldsmiths</pro> who know about this substance sell a
<ms><fr>denier</fr></ms> of it for 5 <cn><fr>sols</fr></cn> to other
<pro>goldsmiths</pro>, &amp; especially to <pro>those who work in plate
and wholesale</pro>, for at the end of their works, they can <m>solder</m>
over the first <m>solder</m> by means of this mixture. In general, all
those who want to mold &amp; cast something delicate. This mixture
should not be divulged, in order that it is not abused.</ab>
