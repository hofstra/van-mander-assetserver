said above, and pestle them separately, keeping your
<span><bp>face</bp></span> covered, over the <span>nose</span> &amp; the
<span>mouth</span>, from the <span>eyes</span> down, to avoid the exhalations of
<m>arsenic</m>, <m>sublimate</m>, and <m>orpiment</m>. Mix them well all
together, then put them in a <span>good crucible</span> that is so large
that the substances can have space of the <span>fourth or fifth part</span>.
Cover the <span>crucible</span> with a <span>good tile</span>, adapted in a
circle precisely on its opening. And having bound it from top to bottom
and on the sides with <span><m>iron wire</m></span> quite strongly, <m>lute</m> it
with <m>earth mixed with dung or founder’s earth, that <span>artillery
founders</span> use</m>. And in this, be careful &amp; diligent, &amp; do
not forget to mix in <m><span>pestled</span> glass</m> throughout the <m>lute</m> to
fortify your <span>crucible</span>, in such a manner that it takes no air, for the
substance would be worth little, because the <s>4</s>
<add>five</add> last ingredients would be exhaled. </div><div data-layout="right-top">

<m>Lute</m>well your <span>crucible</span>, in order that it does not break. For
if it breaks, the substances evaporate &amp; the <md>fumes in it are

and wholesale</span>, for at the end of their works, they can <m>solder</m>
over the first <m>solder</m> by means of this mixture. In general, all
those who want to mold &amp; cast something delicate. This mixture
should not be divulged, in order that it is not abused.</div><div data-layout="left-bottom">
