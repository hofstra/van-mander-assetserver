or <m>wood</m> covered with <m>white iron</m>, to bury more easily these

got</h2><div data-layout="middle">Take some <m>white wax</m> which is more appropriate for this work
than anything else, because it is firmer &amp; does not leave as much
<m>filth</m>, as much as you need to mold the animal that you propose,
&amp; no more, and <span>half</span> as much <m>charcoal, <span>pestled</span> &amp;
finely passed through a <span><m>linen</m></span> or a <span>sleeve</span></m>.
The <m>charcoal</m> gives color <add>and body</add> to the <m>wax</m>,
which would otherwise be transparent &amp; the features would not be
seen as well. Therefore, put your <m>wax</m> to melt in the
<m>charcoal</m> fire. And as it is well melted &amp; liquid, have, for a
<span><span>bowl with handles</span></span> full of <m>melted wax</m>, as much
<m>sulphur</m> <s><span>la</span></s> <span>as a large
<span>walnut</span></span>. Pulverize it, melt it over a slow fire &amp; when
it is melted, do not leave it on the fire because it will become
<add>too</add> hard, but take it away, &amp; always agitate it with a
<span>little stick</span> &amp; let it finish its bubbling &amp; as it is
liquid as <m>water</m>, throw it in the <m>wax</m> that you have removed
from the fire. And mix &amp; always stir the one &amp; the other, in
order that they mix well. Next, mix in, always stirring &amp; in several
goes, <m>the aforesaid pulverized charcoal</m> <corr><s>in several
goes</s></corr>. And as it will be well incorporated, take heed if
your <m>wax</m> has passed its high heat, which you will recognize
<span>when it no longer smokes</span>, <span>when it makes large tracts
<s><add><span>se</span></add></s> <s><span>re</span></s> pulling at the
edges, &amp; motionless, &amp; close <s>to</s> one to another</span>.
For, if you were to cast too hot, you could not separate your <m>wax</m>
from the <span>mold</span>, &amp; it would set in the cast. When it is in
this good state, stir it with a <span>little stick</span>, in order that
<add>the</add> <m>pulverized charcoal</m> is everywhere &amp; not placed
at the bottom. And in this way, cast in your <span>mold</span>, little by
little, &amp; not in one go, because the <m>wax</m>, by its
unctuousness, does not flow

This <m>black sulphured wax</m> is for modelling round figures that are
not for releasing, and that one needs to burn in the <span>mold <span>Ã 
noyau</span></span> before opening it, <s><span>po</span></s> like those
which have arms &amp; legs out front or entwined. And then this
<m>wax</m>, by means of <m>sulphur</m>, melts with very little heat, and
exits without leaving any <m>filth</m>. If, by chance, the <m><span>pestled</span>
charcoal</m> remains there as <m>ash</m>, by opening the <span>mold</span>
&amp; blowing inside, it stays neat.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

@To make <span>snakes</span> with <m>wax</m>, or another thing to fix on a
<span>candle</span>, one needs to cast with <m>modelling wax</m>, in all
colors.</div><div><i>Continued...</i></div></div></folio></body></html>
