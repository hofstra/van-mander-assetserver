to boil <m><span>walnut</span> oil</m> or, even better <m><span>linseed</span>
oil</m>, for a <span>long time</span>. &amp; having boiled for a <span>long
time</span>, you will put in <m><span>garlic</span></m> &amp; <m>bread
crusts</m> to rid it of grease &amp; leave again to boil thoroughly,
then finally you put in one <span>part</span> of <m>lampblack</m> that you
have previously ground on the <span><m>marble</m></span> with <m>oil</m> .
And finally you will mix everything <add>as long as</add> &amp; until
you see that the <span>plate</span> prints well. <s>Which</s> And when
you have spread the <m>ink</m> on it, wipe the <span>plates</span> well with
the surface of a <span>piece of <m>white paper</m></span>. &amp; do this
until the <span><m>paper</m></span> looks clean and then print. If you were
to wipe the <span>plates</span> with a <span><m>linen</m>cloth</span>, it would
remove the <m>ink</m>. <m><span>Linseed</span> oil</m> thickens while
boiling &amp; becomes like a <m>varnish</m> &amp; is in danger of
catching fire. Therefore, when you boil it, make sure it is in an
<span>open space</span> or in a <span>place where the flame cannot cause
damage</span>. Some burn <m>tartar</m> until it is black &amp; grind it
with <m>non-boiled <span>linseed</span> oil</m>, or <m><span>walnut</span>
oil</m> which others find to be better. This <m>black</m> is beautiful,
but the <m>lamp smoke</m> kind is blacker. When you want to print
<s><span>fr</span></s>, take with your <span><span>fingertip</span></span> of
the said <m>black moderately thick</m>, the whole <span>plate</span> having
first been cleaned in <m>lye</m> as said, then, rub it with the surface
of a <span>piece of <m>white paper</m></span> until the
<span><m>paper</m></span> remains white &amp; do not touch it with the
<span>bare hand</span> <s>because</s> but with a <span>piece
of<m>paper</m></span> applied across it. &amp; having cleaned the
<span>plate</span> perfectly, <s><span>mi</span></s> rub again with a
<span>piece of <m>paper</m></span>, fold the edges &amp; sides. Next, take a
<span>small smooth table</span> &amp; on this a <span>piece of
<m>felt</m></span>, then a few <span>sheets of <m>paper</m></span> &amp;
finally the one you want to print on, which should be moistened between
two <span>wet napkins</span>. And on this <m>sheet</m> put your
<span>plate</span> then another piece of <span><m>paper</m></span>, &amp;
finally another<span> <m>felt</m></span>. Then pass between the
<span>rollers</span>. And you can print a dozen pieces consecutively by
always charging the <span>plate</span> with <m>ink</m> &amp; cleaning it as
have done. But if you stop printing, the rest of the <m>ink</m> will dry
in the grooves of the <span>plate</span>. Thus you will have to let it boil
in <m>lye</m> or <m><span>urine</span></m>, as already said, to clean it. The
<span>rollers</span> must not be too loose.</div></div></folio></body></html>
