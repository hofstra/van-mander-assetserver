<span><m>glass</m> or smooth <m>slate</m></span>. Next, mold it with our
above-said sand, <s><span>l’</span></s> having firstly anointed lightly
with <m>oil</m>, as you know, &amp; then rubbed with <m>eau-de-vie</m>,
<s>having</s> and wetting your sand with <m>hot water</m>. Having
the hollow, cast it in <m>alloyed lead</m>, in the same format as other
representations that you make very neatly. However, if it did not come
out at all neatly, repair it. And then, <s>cast some</s> <add>mold
with some</add> <m>wax</m>, on the relief of <m>lead</m>, &amp; you will
have a very neat hollow in the <m>wax</m>, which comes out very neatly
on the <m>lead</m>. Next, in the hollow of <m>wax</m>, cast your wet
sand, which will make for you a relief, on which you will cast your
hollow in <m>silver</m> or another <m>metal</m> for seals. But, note
that one ought not make your hollow with <m>melted wax</m>, but rather,
only heated in <m>warm water</m>, or, even better, in <m>warm
<span>urine</span></m>. Or else, if you have a relief of <m>gold</m> or
<m>silver</m>, or other <m>metal</m>, very <s><span>faço</span></s> neat
&amp; repaired, imprint on top your hollow of <m>wax</m>, &amp; then in
the latter, cast your sand, which will come out in relief, on which you will next cast your hollow for seals or other works. You could even
cast a hollow on the principal part of the <m>metal</m> relief, &amp;
even with <m>lead</m> &amp; <m>tin</m>, which will not melt at all the
principal part if it is with a <span><span>pinceau</span></span> lightly anointed
with <m>crushed chalk</m>, or smoked with <m><span>candle</span> smoke</m> or with
<m>glair of dried egg</m>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">When you have imprinted your seal of
<m>wax</m>, mold in <span>noyau</span> this piece of <m>wax</m>, which is
hollow, like your seal, &amp; your <span>noyau</span> will render it molded,
similar to <s><span>u</span></s> the imprint &amp; the seal.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

It is necessary that your <m>wax</m> be mixed with some color which
hardly has body, in order that you see the imprint better. <m><span>Candle</span>

this effect, is <s><span>exc</span></s> better.</div></div><div id="p153r_2"><h2>Giving the thickness that you wish to a medal</h2><div data-layout="middle">Having cast your first <span>mold</span>, mix <s><span>d</span></s>
