light, pull out the <m>hairs</m> which make the tip too long with the
<span>ends of your fingernails</span>, and this until the tip seems good to
you, &amp; and until you notice in it the <m><span>rat</span> hairs</m>
which are entirely black &amp; the <m>hair of the
<span>petit-gris</span></m> is <s>at the</s>
whitish from the root to the middle. When it pleases you, bind
<s><span>b</span></s> and tighten it very well with a <span>thread</span> in
two places, then cut the excess &amp; fit it in a <m>quill</m> of a
convenient thickness for it, of a <span>duck</span> or a <span>crow</span> for the
small ones. Good <span><span>pinceaulx</span></span> are those that, once soaked
in <m>water</m>, do not bulge when you trace on your <span>hand</span>.</div></div><div id="p067r_1"><h2><m>Oil</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">All <m>oil</m> which is imbibed by <m>paper</m> &amp; once heated by
fire evaporates &amp; leaves the <m>paper</m> clean, like
<m>turpentine</m> &amp; <m><span>spike lavender</span> oil</m>, is good for

at the bottom, like like a <m>charcoal</m> &amp; well inflamed. Next,
you <s><span></span></s> fill it &amp; cover the <m>charcoal</m> &amp;
adjust the <span>bellows</span>, otherwise the <m>metal</m> on top would
melt by means of the <span>bellows</span> &amp; its bottom would be
curdled &amp; cooled &amp; would not run. But if you proceed in this
manner you will melt everything you like.</div></div><div id="p067r_4"><h2><m>Varnish</m> on <m>paper</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">The <span>Germans</span> make boxes <s>p</s> covered with painted

lavender</span></m>, but another <span>odorant</span> that resembles
<m><span>olive</span> oil</m></m>. Every work done with <m>glair</m>
supports <m>oil</m>. It is with this that <span>painters</span> trick the

carries away everything.</div></div></folio></body></html>
