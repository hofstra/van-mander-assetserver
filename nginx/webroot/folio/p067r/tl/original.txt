light, pull out the <m>hairs</m> which make the tip too long with the
<bp>ends of your fingernails</bp>, and this until the tip seems good to
you, &amp; and until you notice in it the <m><al>rat</al> hairs</m>
which are entirely black &amp; the <m>hair of the
<al>petit-gris</al><comment>c_67r_01</comment></m> is <del>at the</del>
whitish from the root to the middle. When it pleases you, bind
<del><fr>b</fr></del> and tighten it very well with a <tl>thread</tl> in
two places, then cut the excess &amp; fit it in a <m>quill</m> of a
convenient thickness for it, of a <al>duck</al> or a <al>crow</al> for the
small ones. Good <tl><fr>pinceaulx</fr></tl> are those that, once soaked
in <m>water</m>, do not bulge when you trace on your <bp>hand</bp>.</ab>

<head><m>Oil</m></head>

<ab>All <m>oil</m> which is imbibed by <m>paper</m> &amp; once heated by
fire evaporates &amp; leaves the <m>paper</m> clean, like
<m>turpentine</m> &amp; <m><pa>spike lavender</pa> oil</m>, is good for
making <m>varnish</m>.</ab>

<ab>Before you put in the <m>metal</m>, it is necessary that it be red
at the bottom, like like a <m>charcoal</m> &amp; well inflamed. Next,
you <del><ill/></del> fill it &amp; cover the <m>charcoal</m> &amp;
adjust the <tl>bellows</tl>, otherwise the <m>metal</m> on top would
melt by means of the <tl>bellows</tl> &amp; its bottom would be
curdled &amp; cooled &amp; would not run. But if you proceed in this
manner you will melt everything you like.</ab>

<head><m>Varnish</m> on <m>paper</m></head>

<ab>The <pl>Germans</pl> make boxes <del>p</del> covered with painted
<m>paper</m> &amp; varnish it with <m>glair of egg</m> mixed with
<m>gum</m> &amp; a little <m><m>oil</m>, not of <m><pa>spike
lavender</pa></m>, but another <sn>odorant</sn> that resembles
<m><pa>olive</pa> oil</m></m>. Every work done with <m>glair</m>
supports <m>oil</m>. It is with this that <pro>painters</pro> trick the
<pro>poor peasants</pro>, painting their bands of <m>taffeta</m> with
this <m>glair</m>, to be done sooner. But <env>the first rain</env>
carries away everything.</ab>
