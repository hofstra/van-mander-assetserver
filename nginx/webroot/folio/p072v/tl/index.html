more so than <m>tin</m>. And when it is not hot enough, it makes lines
in the medal. <s>It</s> <m>Straw</m> burns in it, provided it is
hot. One can make a <m>solder</m> so soft &amp; runny that it can be
melted in a <span><m>tin</m> dish</span>. It is composed of one
<span>part</span> <m>looking glass tin</m>, one <span>part</span> <m>soft
tin</m>, &amp; another <span>part</span> <m>lead</m>. It runs very neatly
and is cast in leaves, but the work is very brittle &amp; breakable. The best <m>solder</m> is the common one for casting well, but
<s>is</s> leaves certain lumpy points. Alloy <m>lead</m> with
<m>tin</m> so that the ingot that you will cast comes out even &amp;
shiny &amp; polished, &amp; without any eyes or bubbles except for a
small point in the middle. And this sign will tell you that there is
enough <m>tin</m>, otherwise the <m>lead</m> dominates too much. Sand is
good for <m>lead</m> &amp; <m>tin</m>. The good one is very thin &amp;
fine &amp; lean, which however sticks together between oneâ€™s
<span><span>fingers</span></span>. The sand wants to be reheated before putting
it to use. And <s>once</s> to mold <add>with it</add>, it wants to
be very moistened &amp; then reheated, not all at once nor with a burst
of fire, for this corrupts &amp; makes it shrink &amp; crumble as well.
But if you reheat it gently, it renders itself very stiff, once well
moistened. One ought to pass it through a <span>shirt
<add>sleeve</add></span> for the finest one, in order to first put some on
the piece to mold.</div><div data-layout="middle">One makes a <m>solder</m> with <m>quicksilver</m>
<s>but</s>which is white, but it is brittle. Make your <span>frame</span> so that it joins well &amp; that one does not see the daylight
between the joints.</div><div data-layout="middle">The <span>Germans</span> cast their <m>leads</m> very thinly, rather
than very thickly, because it seems they come out better, but so that
are not too pliant, being so thin, they mix a little <m>tin</m> with the
said <m>lead</m>, which otherwise would fold up like <m>wax</m>.</div><div data-layout="middle">The blackest <m>lead</m>, so say some, is the best &amp; the softest
&amp; which runs the best. <span>You will know its goodness by rubbing it
with your <span><span>finger</span></span>, which will render it very black
quickly</span>. </div><div data-layout="middle">The alloy good for running <m>lead</m> &amp; <m>tin</m> is per one
<span>lb</span> of <m>lead</m>, one <span>lb</span> &amp; a half of <m>tin</m>
<s><span>aultr</span></s>, such that the tin exceeds more than one
<span>part</span>. It is <m>solder</m> which flows well &amp; is good
for casting, but it is brittle.</div><div data-layout="right-top">



To make the <m>lead</m> flow well, one puts in a little
<m>quicksilver</m>.</div><div data-layout="left-top">



Rub <m><span>cuttlefish</span> bone</m> on a <span>well smooth table</span> to
flatten it &amp; one against the other &amp; cross the two <m>bones</m>
with <span>pegs</span> to mark the place.</div><div data-layout="left-top">



<span><m><span>Cuttlefish</span> bone</m></span> molds <m>lead</m> better than
anything else. But try it to see if it needs reheating. <s>One ought
to mold on the back of the <m>bones</m> &amp; from this side for the
<m>marrow</m> is more delicate there.</s></div><div data-layout="left-middle">



The <m>bone marrow</m> towards the tail is more delicate &amp; does have
not as many stripes &amp; molds more cleanly. The <m>shell</m> which
holds the <m>marrow</m>, once calcined, is good for making sand.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



When you cast <m>lead</m>, you need to cast it <s>cast very
neatly</s> <add>rather</add> hot, &amp; not at once &amp; shake the
<span>frame</span> a little &amp; cast two or three times. However, if it
is cast too hot, it will rise up &amp; swell. When it is very hot, it
becomes blue, let it then pass this color <s><span>deva</span></s> &amp;
rest a little before casting.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



Some, such as <span>printers</span>, mix <m>iron filings</m> or
<m>pins</m> in the <m>lead</m>, <s>but</s> in order to render it
hard. But this renders it brittle &amp;<s>not</s> it breaks under
the <span>hammer</span>.</div><div data-layout="left-bottom">
