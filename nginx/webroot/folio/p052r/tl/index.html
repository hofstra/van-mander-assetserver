<s><m>rye</m></s> <add><m>barley</m></add> &amp; <m>straw</m>
<s><span>pig</span></s> cut in the manner one feeds <span>horses</span> in
<span>Spain</span>, and water it with <m>good fountain or river
<m>water</m></m>. I do not know if it would be good to water it
occasionally with <m>water of sulfurous baths</m>, &amp; to sometimes
give it <m><span>fenugreek</span></m> or other hot foods, for the intention
of the <span>worker</span> is <s>to it</s> to use the heat of its
<m>dung</m>, &amp; the climate here is cooler than that of
<span>Algiers</span>. Keep it in a <span>warm &amp; close place</span> &amp;
so that none of its <m>dung</m> &amp; <m><span>urine</span></m> should be lost, of
which you will make a heap or two in order that while one cools, the
other will be at the appropriate heat to continue. Also take a<span> large
<m>glass</m> mattras</span>, as thick as you can, &amp; one
<span><span>finger</span></span> thick if it can be done, &amp; of the
<span>capacity of one <span>pitcher</span> or <span><m>earthen</m>
jug</span></span>. <span>Around the feast of <span>St John</span></span>, put into
it a dozen &amp; a half <m>chicken eggs</m>, that is to say, the
<m>yolk</m> without the <m>glair</m> &amp; the <m>germ</m> (see). Others
say lx <m>yolks</m>. And <s>it will be</s> with this dozen &amp; a
half <m>egg yolks</m> put in <span>half an ounce</span> (others say for lx
<m>eggs</m> <span>half a lb</span>) of <m><span><add>female</add> silkworm
seeds</span></m>. And after having <m>luted</m> the
<span>mattras</span> well (I do not know if there needs to be air for the
generation), put it &amp; bury it in the heat of the <m>dung</m> up to
the neck, and leave it there until several <s><span>f<span></span></span></s>
<span>worms</span> are engendered. And then remove the <span>mattras</span>
&amp; do not bury it in the <m>dung</m> any longer, but only keep it
placed on the hot layer of the <m>dung</m>
until all the <span>worms</span> will have eaten &amp; consumed one
<s><span>d</span></s> another, bustling &amp; stirring, and only one
remains. When this is the case you need to feed it <span>at regular
intervals, day &amp; night</span>, with the aid of two men, who by
intervals will take care of it, and you will feed it with an <m>egg
yolk</m> covered with a <m>gold leaf</m>, or with a liquid <m>egg
yolk</m> with the <m>gold leaf</m> incorporated; &amp; take good care
that it does not want for such food (some say one <m>egg yolk</m> per
<span>hour</span>, others three, but the thing itself will demonstrate the
practice). Nourished in this way it will achieve its growth in two
<span>months</span> or seven <span>weeks</span> &amp; will become like a
<span>snake</span>, one <span><span>empan</span></span> &amp; 4
<span><span>fingers</span></span> long, &amp; one <span>lb</span> in weight, and as
the wings begin to arise on it, one will need to make it die, doing so
with a <m>charcoal</m> fire in a ring around the <span>bottle</span> one
<span><span>empan</span></span> distant from it, and then stopper &amp;
<m>lute</m> the <span>bottle</span> well in order that it does not
exhale.</div><div><i>Continued...</i></div></div></folio></body></html>
