<m>filings</m>. For if the <m>vinegar</m> <add>is good</add>, you will
see it boil with large bubbles <s>as if it</s> on the <m>rust</m>,
as it it were on the fire, on the <m>fillings</m>, it does not boil
unless it is put on the fire or <m>hot ashes</m>. However, when the
<m>fillings</m> are passed through <m>vinegar</m> &amp; you have made it
evaporate &amp; heat up &amp; it is very red, if you do this again for a
second time, the <m>vinegar</m> will have much more strength, &amp; the
<m><span>crocum</span></m> will only be finer for it &amp; redder. Those who
use it to cast in <m>gold</m> <s><span>ven</span></s> buy the
<span>ounce</span> for forty or fifty <span><span>sols</span></span>.</div><div data-layout="left-top">



It does not harden the <span>molds</span>, and, in scraping, one cannot tell
that they are harder from it. But it makes the <span>mold</span> less dense,
and it drinks in and attracts the <m>gold</m> better.</div></div><div id="p126v_2"><h2><m>Plaster</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">You can mold with it as large a piece as you please. But if you take
your <span>molds</span> from large works &amp; pieces of <m>wood</m>, it
will not release well, unless you <s>boil</s> make your <m>wood</m>
imbibe <m>very hot wax</m>. For the <m>wood</m> absorbs &amp; drinks
&amp; in this way attracts the <m>plaster</m>. You can assume the same
thing for any other large piece of work. But the cure is to
<s><span>l’ab</span></s> saturate <s><span>l’ouvra</span></s> with <m>very
hot wax</m> the work on which you want to cast your <m>plaster</m>. For,
by this means, it will not drink it up &amp; will release very
neatly.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

If the <m>plaster</m> shrinks, it will always make flashing. Find some hard
ones and <s>it</s> put your <span>molds</span> well in the <span>press</span> before
casting.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">It is not good when it
shrinks.</div></div><div id="p126v_3"><h2>Plants difficult to burn in the <span>noyau</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">Any plant which has a hard stem &amp; like <m>wood</m> is very
difficult to burn in the <span>noyau</span>, such as <span>asparagus</span>,
<span>thyme</span>, &amp; similar things, because they stay as <m>coal</m>
in the small conduits, &amp; if they do not reduce well into
<m>ashes</m>, it is not possible to empty them from the <span>mold</span>.
Some reheat them, to this effect, two or <s><span>d</span></s> three
times. Others, putting several plants together in the <span>mold</span>,
pass through <s>threads</s> the plants &amp; <add>the</add>
<s><span>es <span>moules</span></span></s> <span>circle of <m>earth</m></span>,
which is to receive the wet sand,<s><span>plusi</span></s></div><div data-layout="left-bottom">

This does proceed from plants that have a stem with lines, because
<span>rosemary</span> burns well, but it is in the nature of certain
plants.</div><div><i>Continued...</i></div></div></folio></body></html>
