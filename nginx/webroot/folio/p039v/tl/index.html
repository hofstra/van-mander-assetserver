<m>enamel</m> &amp; thick green take to it very well. Having

can do it in different ways. Lay your <m>glass pane</m> <s>on</s>,
the thinnest you can find, on the printed history, &amp; having cleaned
the <m>glass</m> well with <m>lye</m> &amp; <m>ash</m> so that it is not
greasy, trace over the lines visible to you with <m><span>noir à
huile</span></m> or <m><span>noir d’escaille</span></m> with the
<span><span>pinceau</span></span>, if you want to paint with colors in the
fashion of <span>glassworkers</span>, who wash their <m>glass pane</m> with
<m><span>noir d’escaille</span></m> &amp; then scrape &amp; clear the parts
which they want to coat with color, leaving that which is necessary for
shading. But if you want to make <m>gilt</m> histories on <m>glass</m>
with a background of colors, which imitates the <span>basse-taille</span> of
<span>goldsmiths</span>, <m>gild</m> your entire <m>glass pane</m> with
<m>gum water</m> or <m><span>garlic</span> juice</m> or <m>milk of the <span>fig tree</span></m>.
Then moisten your printed history between two wet
<span><m><span>linen</span> cloths</m></span>, and lay it down on the <m>gilt
glass</m>. Then with a <span>pin</span> mounted on the end of a small
<span>stick</span>, follow the lines of your history as if you wanted to
pounce it, &amp; thus you will exactly trace it on the <m>gilding of
the glass</m>. &amp; next you will clear the background &amp; that
which needs to be blank with a quite pointy <span><m>steel</m> awl</span>,
&amp; and neatly follow once more the lines &amp; accomplish your work
&amp; fashion your faces &amp; flesh tones in <m><span>argent moulu</span></m>;
then you shall fill the background with <m><span>azur d’esmail</span></m> or
<m>verdigris</m> or <m>fine <span>laque
platte</span></m> <s><span>platte</span></s> tempered with <m>clear
turpentine</m>, mixed with a little of <m>tear of mastic</m> if you want
that the colors hold together more &amp; not to spread. Next, layer on
the back of the <m>glass</m> &amp; over the colors a <m>white tin</m>
sheet. And once this is dry, you can cover the <m>tin</m> sheet
