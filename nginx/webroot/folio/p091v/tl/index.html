<s><span>co</span></s> cut them evenly all around, &amp; make notches
<s><span>e</span></s> around it in different places which cross over the
joining of the two <span><m>bones</m></span>, in order to recognize well the
place of the first joining. Or else, with little <span>shards of
<m>wood</m></span>, pierce them, or <s><span>ma</span></s> coat the
joinings with some <m>clay</m>, &amp; dry. Press <s>between them</s>
your <span><span>hands</span> joined between your<span> two </span>knees</span>;
&amp; not with a <span>press</span>, because the <span><m>bones</m></span> would
burst. Mold also at your leisure &amp; two or three times, until you see
that it is well pressed tightly together &amp; well imprinted. And each
time before replacing the piece, <span>ponce</span> with some
<m><span>willow</span> charcoal</m>, for it makes it release well. When you
have cast, rub the medal with <m>oil</m> &amp; with <m><span>willow</span>
charcoal powder</m> &amp; with a <span>brush</span>, to make it dull. Guard
against your medal being too greasy or <m>oily</m>, when you mold in
<span><m><span>cuttlefish</span> bone</m></span>. When you have cast, leave it
to cool before taking the medal out, for when one takes it out hot, it
brings with it some <span><m>bone</m></span>. And, cast moderately hot,
something you will know when the <span><m>bone</m></span> is about to change
its <s>good</s> whiteness. But when it is too hot, it really waxes
the <span><m>bone</m></span> red. The <span>proportion</span> of <m>lead</m>
&amp; <m>tin</m> is as much one as the other. If the piece is difficult
to come out, &amp; of several pieces, make the cast forked with three or
four grooves, <s>and make</s> &amp; direct these grooves to the
place of thickest parts. Also make these grooves around the medal, like
directly on the head, for this attracts the <m>metal</m> &amp; feeds
the figure best. Shake your <span>frame</span> a little when you have cast,
and thus you will make very neatly several casts. <m>Tin</m> that is too
hot burns the <span><m>bone</m></span>, which is corrupted. Also, once taken
out <s><span>du mo</span></s>hot from the <span>mold</span>, it risks
breaking.
