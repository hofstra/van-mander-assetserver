it fits well also on the <span>board</span> where it sits, so that it holds
firm &amp; does not shift when one molds. It is necessary that the sand
be clean &amp; well chosen and well reheated, &amp; pulverised very
finely on the <span><m>marble</m></span>, for the one that you want to put
first on the medal, and when molding you press strongly. Guard against
<m>oiling</m> your medal, for this would make it porous. Reheat slowly
and reheat well, &amp; let cool. Moisten your sand with <m>wine boiled
with <span>elm</span> root</m>, and cast <m>latten</m> which comes out well,
namely from the <m>substance of the <span>trebuschets</span></m> and similar
thin things. Make your cast broad &amp; even if it is barely thick, it
will not be worse off, but it will enter well in the <span>mold</span>. Cast
from the foot of the medal, in order that the face, further away from the
heat, comes out better &amp; sweetened from the violent heat. And if
your <span>frame</span> does not have vents, make some
<s><span>qu</span></s> in the sand, which come, from the corners of the
piece, to render themselves into the cast. Cast very hot, something that
you will know, when you cast a little leftover substance in the one
which has already been melted, &amp; if it melts quickly, this is a sign
it is <s><span>fo</span></s> well hot. At that time, invigorate the heat
of your <span>furnace</span> with <span>bellows</span> of the right size,
keeping the mouth of the <span>furnace</span> well covered with some large
<s><m>copper</m></s> <span><m>tile</m></span> or other similar thing,
which should be very red before you cast. When you want to cast, take
your well red <span><span>mollettes</span></span> &amp; the <span>crooked
<m>iron</m></span> as well, to clean the <m>charcoals</m> which are in
your substance. Having cast, rub your work with a <span><m>latten</m>
wirebrush</span>. The <m>grindings from sharpening large scissors &amp;
large knives</m> is very good for <m>copper</m>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">
