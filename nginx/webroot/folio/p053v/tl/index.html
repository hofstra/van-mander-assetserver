by the <span>ounce</span>, which is commonly sold in <span>Languedoc</span> iii
<span>lb</span> v <span>s</span>. The one from <span>Spain</span> that
<span>merchants</span> bring there is considered the best because the
<span>worms</span> which come from there are not so subject to illnesses
&amp; make more <m>silk</m>. In <span>Spain</span>, one <span>ounce</span> of
<s><m>silk</m></s> seed, they produce there <span>worms</span> which
commonly yield <s><span>ord</span></s> xv <span>lb</span> of <m>silk</m>.
But <s><span>l’<span>once</span></span></s> from one <span>ounce</span> of seed
produced in <span>France</span>, they only return x or xii. Three
<span>ounces</span> of seed are for producing such a quantity of
<span>worms</span>, that with them you will be able to furnish a <span>room
accomodated with three or 4 shelves of large shelves</span>. Willingly
they begin to unskin themselves <span>around holy week</span>. And to do
this, one puts them in a <span><span>fir</span> box</span>, like those where one
puts <span>dragée</span>, warmly among <span>feather cushions</span>. And at the
beginning, they unskin themselves like <s><span>f</span></s> little
<span>black ants</span>, &amp; as soon as there are two or three unskinned,
one needs to give them <m><span>white mulberry</span> leaves</m>, and then
arrange them on the <span>shelves</span>. And three <span>times <span>per
day</span></span>, one needs to exchange <m>fresh leaves</m>. And if
<span>during the day</span> there is some <span>thunder <add>or rainy
weather, cloud-covered &amp; cool</add></span>, one needs to keep in the
<span>room</span> three or 4 <span>chafing dishes <s>&amp;</s> with
glowing charcoal</span>, &amp; put in <m>incense</m> until all the
<span>room</span> would be filled with <m>smoke</m>. And when the
<span>weather is warm &amp;<span>serain</span></span>, the <m>silk</m> abounds
more &amp; and then it is better. Some <span>worms</span> make it whiter,
others more yellowish. And even if it may be white, it yellows when one
draws it through <span><m>hot water</m></span> <s><span>despuys</span></s>.
The <span>worms</span>, <span>from their birth until the <s>their</s>
time when they make their cocoons &amp; their prisons</span>, sleep &amp;
rest 4 times, &amp; each time remain 4 or five <span><span>days</span></span>
resting without eating, as if they were dying for rebirth another time,
for each time they change skin &amp; begin by unskinning the head then
consequently, on different <span>days</span>, the <s><span>s</span></s>
rest of the body, &amp; from white turn grayish, &amp; from grayish to
white <s><span>en fin</span></s>. And if one of them has some illness
who does not have the strength to unskin, one needs to help it &amp;
prevent puncturing it, for at that time rendering a yellow liquor, it is
no longer worth anything. And further they scarcely profit after one has
handled it with the <span><span>hand</span></span>. <span>Around Pentecost</span>,
they begin to want to climb on the dry branches of <span>heath</span> or
<span>heather</span> that one prepares for them <s><span>en</span></s> &amp;
