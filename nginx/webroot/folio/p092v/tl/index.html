<m>☿</m> &amp; it will come out like <m>tin</m> if you
remelt it, but it will be breakable. And If you want to assay if it is
<m>tin</m> or <m>☿</m>, redden a <span>shovel</span> &amp;
put a small lump of your ingot on top. If it is <m>tin</m>, it will melt
&amp; stay, but if it is <m>☿</m>, will quickly melt,
then when crackling well, it will evaporate. One ought to congeal it in
a <span>spoon</span> or in a <span>hollow crucible</span>, &amp; make a
moderately sized hole.</div><div data-layout="middle">It can also be congealed, as I assayed, in <m><span>aqua

<m>tin</m>, <m>looking glass tin</m>, <m>fine lead</m>, <span>as much of

breakable &amp; white. I think that it would be good for <m>solder</m>.
A long time to cool.</div></div></folio></body></html>
