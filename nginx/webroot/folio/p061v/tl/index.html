it into a big <span>bottle</span>. And behind this, put your

<m>glass</m>, but of <m>canvas</m> anointed with <m>clear turpentine
varnish</m>, namely <span>half</span> <m>turpentine oil</m> &amp; <span>almost
half</span> <m>turpentine</m>, because this light, which is not as bright
as from <m>glass</m>, makes features appear larger to them. And when they want
to make something subtle like veins <s><span>de</span></s> &amp; similar
things, they use <span><span>pinceaulx</span> composed of two or three
<m><span>rat</span>whiskers</m></span>.</div></div><div id="p061v_3"><h2><m><span>Azur dâ€™esmail</span></m> in <m>oil</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">One needs too choose the most <s>beautiful</s> delicate that
will be possible, for if it is coarse one cannot work with it in
<m>oil</m>. And if you do not find any that is subtle enough, you can
grind it well, not with <m>water</m> but with <m>oil</m>, &amp; grind it
thickly. Next lay it on your <span>palette</span> &amp; mix in a little
<m>turpentine</m>, but not much, to give it a bond, and make it to be as
thick as <m>butter</m> or <m>mortar</m>, &amp; then, with a <span>fairly
large <span>pinceau</span></span>, work it by always moving the
<span><span>pinceau</span></span> back and forth. Then, to soften it, hatch
across it in a jagged manner with <s>the</s> the <span>tip of the
<span>pinceau</span></span>. The highlights will be made with
<s><span>d</span></s> the same thinned <corr>with</corr> <m>ceruse</m>,
which, giving it a bond, makes it easier to work. I have seen it used
thus. It must be very thick, &amp; such that you all but struggle to
spread it with your <span><span>pinceau</span></span>. And it is all the better
if you lay down your panel. All these difficulties do not arise when it
is very subtle &amp; thin without being ground, and does not run.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



<m>Azure</m> wants to be layered neatly, which is why
<s><span>quan</span></s> it always dies somewhat when layers it over
old, already tarnished, <m>azure</m> to mend an old panel. In such
matters, it is better to scrape off the old layer &amp; prime again,
then put down the <m>azure</m>. It is thus for almost all other colors.
Also, <m>azure</m> ground with <m>oil</m> always remains shiny, which is
not a good sign for <m>azure</m> for this causes it to die.</div></div><div id="p061v_4"><h2>Grinding colors</h2><div data-layout="middle">A slab of <s>marble &amp; <span>p</span></s> <m>glass</m> <span>a

<m>lake</m> &amp; for whites.</div></div></folio></body></html>
