<m>sal ammoniac</m> &amp; <m>saltpeter</m>, which removes <m>filth</m>

to make it even, as this is important for the casting. <m>Lute</m> also,
or cover the mouth of the <span>frame</span> with sand in order that the melted
<m>metal</m>, or <m>lead</m>,or <m>copper</m> does not touch the
<span>frame</span>â€™s <m>iron</m> or <m>latten</m>, because it makes it
brittle, &amp; makes it porous. Also make sure that the cast is always
higher than the <span>mold</span>. Also guard against the cast being too
wide or too deep because the narrower, the better. For when it is big,
the weight of the substance that runs breaks &amp; shakes loose the
<span>mold</span> &amp; makes it porous. When you have cast, gently tap the
<span>frame</span>, in order that the substance spreads better. <m>Black lead of
<span>saulmon</span></m> from the first melting makes a very neat one.</div></div></folio></body></html>
