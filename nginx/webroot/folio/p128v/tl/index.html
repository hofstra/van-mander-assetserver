You will see that it will torment it &amp; heat it very well and soon
render it very liquid &amp; ready to cast and be clarified, as it should
be. When it is in this state &amp; that it is very white and polished,
shining like <m>quicksilver</m>, prepare yourself to cast. And to this
effect, have some <m>lean delicate sand</m>, in a
<span><span>terrine</span></span> or another <span>vessel</span>, that you would
like to help yourself to. Make a pit in your sand, then, with your
<span>pincers</span>, take your <span>well reddened mold</span> &amp; place it
in this pit of sand. Cover immediately the opening of your <span>mold
</span>in order that no <m>ash </m>&amp; dust enters inside, &amp; then
enclose it with sand up to end of the gate &amp; the vents. This done,
uncover your <span>mold </span>&amp; throw on top of your <span>well melted
silver</span>, the <span>size of a <span>pea</span></span>, or thereabouts, some
of this metallic <span>grain</span>, which will immediately spread through
all your <m>silver</m> &amp; make it boil &amp; turn. Cast as soon as
you have put in this substance, for it is this that is the secret to
making the <m>silver </m>run, since its crust heats it &amp; clarifies
it. You can cast <m>silver finer than the alloy from the <span>capital
</span>and like the <span>realle</span></m>, but you must add this
<span>grain</span> in.</div><div data-layout="left-top">



With all of this, do not let yourself forget to put, before all things,
a little <m>borax </m>in the <m>melted silver</m>, for even though
<span>goldsmiths</span> do not put any in, however it is good, and I have
seen it practised well. Next, one puts in the crust of the substance at
two different times &amp; then the metallic thing. Then make sure that
it be placed at the end of your <span>forge</span>.</div><div data-layout="left-top">



If you want to blow the <m>ash</m>that is around your <span>mold</span> when
you hold it between the <span>pincers</span>, hold it with the opening at
the bottom, &amp; blow.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



When <m>silver</m> is well melted you can uncover it and blow with the
<span>small bellows</span>, not continually like with <m>gold</m>, but only
to cast out the <m>charcoals</m> in order to put in the substances that
make it run.</div></div><div id="p128v_1"><h2>Whitening of cast <m>silver</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">

Because one commonly casts in <m>base silver</m>, &amp; especially the
<span>Germans</span>, and that such an alloy readily makes <span>chappe</span>
or crust, <s>which is contrary to</s> <s>our</s> some
<span>goldsmiths</span> <s>from <span>France</span></s> are usually quick
to whiten their works, especially rough ones, because they only
use <m>common <span>bullitoyre</span></m>, which is <m>tartar</m> &amp;
<m>common salt</m>, <span>nearly as much of one as the other</span>. But I
have seen an excellent <span>German</span> working thus. Having, in my
presence, cast a <span>little lizard</span> with an <m>alloy of
<span>teston</span></m>, he made a greyish <s><span>noi</span></s> crust.
And to clean it from it, he boiled it in the above mentioned
<m><span>bullitoyre</span></m> of <m>tartar</m> &amp; <add>pulverized</add>
<m>common salt</m> <s>and</s> mixed with <m>common water</m>, in the
fire of his <span>forge</span>. Once taken out, he <span>brushed</span> it. And
because it was not as clean of this crust as he fancied, he burned some
<m>tartar</m> <add>in some <span><m>paper</m></span></add> until it was
black &amp; no longer smoked. Then, he wet the aforesaid <m>tartar</m>
<s><span>d</span></s> with the <m>water of <span>bullitoyre</span></m> ,
composed of <m>salt</m> &amp; <m>tartar</m>, &amp; covered all his
<span>lizard</span> with it. Then he put it between the live <s>of</s>
charcoals of his <span>forge</span> &amp; blew a little. When the
<span>lizard</span> was red, he took it out, let it cool, then reheated it
in the <m><span>bullitoyre</span></m>. Next, he <span>brushed</span> it in
<m>clear water</m>. </div><div data-layout="left-middle">



<mark>+</mark>

Note that the <m><span>bullitoyre</span></m> for <m>silver</m> is never good
in a <span>crucible</span> because the water, taking the form of the
<s><span>f</span></s> <m>tartar</m>, evaporates. But the <span>vessel</span>
for boiling, being of <m>copper</m>, is excellent for the whitening of
<m>silver</m> &amp; for the mixture which colors <m>gold</m>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



He heeded to not let his <m>water of tartar</m> boil so much that it
poured out on top, because then its strength goes away. Therefore, when
this first fury of boiling comes, remove it from the fire &amp; put it
back. He held as a secret this <m>burned tartar</m> put on top for
<m>base silver</m>.</div></div></folio></body></html>
