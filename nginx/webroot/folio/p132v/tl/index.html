I have tried to make it so the <span>molds</span> where it is mixed do not crack
during reheating, &amp; thus do not make flashing.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

reddened it in the fire, I had it finely ground on <span>porphyry</span>,
until no roughness was recognisable on the <span><span>nail</span></span>. Then,
I wet it with <m>very good vinegar</m>, &amp; <s><span>a</span></s>
<corr>’</corr> left it two or three <span><span>days</span></span>, stirring
it <span><span>several times each day</span></span>. Finally I boiled it,
&amp; reddened <s>in</s> the <span>pot</span> &amp;
<m><span>crocum</span></m> all together in the <span><span>four à
vent</span></span>. It came back in a mass full of small bubbles, but that
can be pulverized very finely between the <span><span>fingers</span></span>. I
put some in the sand, <s><span>a</span></s> <span>half</span> as much as
<m><span>alum de plume</span></m>. I wet the sand quite thinly &amp; molded
out of it a <span>very small lizard</span>, which molded very neatly &amp;
delicately &amp; very finely. The <m><span>crocum ferri</span></m> did not
render the <span>mold</span> harder, but it firmed it. And when your
<span>mold</span> is <span>douls</span> &amp; fat, when scraping it with a
<span><span>nail</span></span>, it is a sign that the <m><span>crocum</span></m> is
good, very fine &amp; well prepared. The quantity cannot spoil the
<span>mold</span>, because it is a friend to <m>gold</m>. And I believe that
<m>silver</m> would come out well. And that the <span>mold</span>, through
this means, does not crack. <rub>Make it from <m>filings of
needles</m></rub>.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

One can put some amongst the <span>molds</span>, where you want to cast
<m>silver</m>, for it firms the <span>molds</span>, and you will find it so,
by scraping a little harder than the other where there is none. It molds
very neatly.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

This one is appropriate for all <span>molds</span>, &amp; keeps them from
breaking &amp; bursting in the fire. And for flat medals, it withstands
several casts. The one of <m>steel fillings &amp; needles</m> is redder
&amp; better.</div></div><div id="p132v_3"><h2><m>Gilding</m> animals cast in <m>silver</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">You can <m>gild </m>them with <m>amalgam</m>, without spoiling any
