are not fully drawn by the tang because he does this himself to adjust
them well to the <s><span>l</span></s> pommel &amp; guards.</div><div data-layout="middle"><span>Spanish</span> ones are deemed better for being of <m>better steel
&amp;iron</m> but they are not as <span>well-forged</span> as swords from
<span>Vienne</span> in <s><span>pro</span></s> <span>Dauphiné</span>. The
<span>Spanish</span> ones are not as well ground coming from the
<span>forge</span> because they grind them with the
<span><span>foot</span></span> &amp; this is what
makes them wavy.</div><div data-layout="middle">Blades from <span>Vienne</span> commonly cost xviii or 19
<span><span>lb</span> a dozen</span>.</div><div data-layout="middle">The first thing the <span>furbisher</span> does when he gets his new
blades is to draw out their tang, which he does himself, or has done by
<span>locksmiths</span> or <span>farriers</span>, giving him some
<span>liard</span> for his charcoal. Next, they
pass it over a <span>grindstone</span> to make it
cut, then lay it down on the
<span><span>chameau</span></span>, and <add>with</add> some <m>pulverized
emery</m>, fine &amp; soft as <m>flour</m>, &amp; mixed with <m>oil</m>
to make it hold, they furbish the sword with the <span>stick</span> used to
remove the traces of the <span>grindstone</span> and then <s>the</s>
clean <s><span>po</span></s> the sword <add>well</add> with the
<m>emery</m>, and give it a <span>drop</span> or two of <m>oil</m> which
they spread with the <span><span>finger</span></span> to give it luster. Having
put the <m>oil</m>, they furnish the sword again on the
<span><span>chameau</span></span> with the
<span><m><span><span>felin</span></span></m></span> which is a
<span><m>thunderstone</m></span> mounted in the middle of a stick like the
<span><span>fustée</span></span>, and this stick is called the <span><span>baton à
<m>felinder</m></span></span>. Next, having passed it on the
<span><m><span>felin</span></m></span>, they furbish it with <m>chalk</m> &amp;
the <m>oil</m> which is on the sword. Next, they wipe it &amp; go over
it again, &amp; furbish with <m>dry chalk</m>. And at the end, when they
are ready mounted, one gives them the edge with the
<span><span>gratteau</span></span>.
<s><span>Ai</span></s></div><div data-layout="middle">Once furbished, one mounts it on the guards which one presents to
know if they are quite suitable. And taking hold of a blade such that
the whole ricasso is held in the <span><span>hand</span></span>, one conjectures
that it will be just as heavy once mounted.</div><div data-layout="middle">One puts the blade in a <span>vice</span> between two pieces of
<m>wood</m>, then with a <span>file</span> they enlarge the opening of the
guard if it is necessary. Then to rivet it,
one places on the tang <s>a piece of</s>
&amp; the pommel a piece of <m>wood</m> &amp; with a <span>hammer</span>,
one beats on it to align &amp; secure the pommel well. Then with the
<span>hammer</span>, one works the tang when the pommel is well secured
&amp; does not wobble. The <m>wood</m> is put there so as not to spoil
the pommel. Next, one fits the tang with a <span>file</span> or
<span>chisel</span>. And some make <s>the <span>b</span></s> the tang in a
square diamond-shape but it is not as good
as the round one, for when faceted, the tang breaks.</div><div><i>Continued...</i></div></div></folio></body></html>
