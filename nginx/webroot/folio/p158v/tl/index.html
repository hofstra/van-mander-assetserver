colors have no hold. For <span>marigold flowers</span>, <m>lightly ground
minium</m> for some, &amp; for others which are more yellowish, a bit of
<m>massicot</m> with it. For green, the <m>verdigris</m> has depth &amp;
is too dark. If it is a yellowish green, you can mix with the
<m>verdigris</m> a little <m>yellow ochre</m> &amp; <m>stil de grain
yellow</m>. If the green is dark, put with it <m>charcoal of <span>peach
tree</span> pits</m>, which makes a <s>v</s> greenish black, in the
same way that black of <m><span>ox</span> foot bone</m> looks bluish. And
thus, by judgement &amp; discretion, put the color on the <m>natural
flower or leaf</m> to see whether it comes close. But layer it
transparently so as not to cover the lines of the work.</div></div><div id="p158v_2"><h2>Large <span>molds</span></h2><div data-layout="middle">Because of the great weight of the <m>metal</m>, they want to be put

fumigated my <span><span>moules</span> de noyau</span> for <m>tin</m> &amp;
<m>lead</m>, and have cast in the cold <span>mold</span> well dried
beforehand, and it came out very neat. It is true that <m>lead</m> mixed
with half of <m>tin</m> was very hot, because the medal was thick.</div></div><div id="p158v_4"><h2>Gate</h2><div data-layout="middle"><s>Even though</s> <add>If</add> the medal is very thick, for
this reason do not give it as thick of a gate. It suffices for the gate
to have <span>half of its thickness</span>. But if it <corr>is</corr> thin,
give it a gate of its thickness. Do not forget to make vents in the gate
where typically the material becomes porous.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">



Never forget to <m>oil</m> the <m>wax</m> gate when you mold plants
or flowers, otherwise it breaks &amp; cannot be taken out.
