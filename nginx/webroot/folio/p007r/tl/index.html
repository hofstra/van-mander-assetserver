stamped ornament in <m>tin</m> as said, or
in <m>iron</m> <s><span>dest</span></s> or <m>copper</m>, one ought not
to put a layer of <m>glue</m> here as on <m>wood</m>, but take only
<m>fatty oil</m>, which is made in seven or eight <span>days</span> <span>in
the sun</span> with <m>walnut oil</m> and <m>lead white</m> <s>&amp;
with</s>, stirring it often, or cooking it on the fire if one is in
haste. Then, with the <m>oil</m> thus made fatty, grind a little <m>lead
white</m>, <m>massicot</m> &amp; <m><span>mine de plomb</span></m>
<s><span></span></s>, at discretion, as much of one as of the other.
<m>Minium</m> gives color to the <m>gold</m>. Next, with this, you make
a layer of it evenly on your stamp, taking care not to fill the hollows.
And once it is almost dry, lay the <m>gold</m> leaf on it with
<m>cotton</m>. Such <m>gold</m> will hold up <span>in the rain</span> on
houses &amp; elsewhere. And if you have gilded with <m>tinsel</m>, color
it with <m><span>fumée de perdrix</span></m> or from yellow or red
<m>cloth</m>, &amp; it will be beautiful like pure <m>gold</m>. You can
cover trunks, mirrors, canopies &amp; posts of beds of colored
<m>velvet</m> or <m>satin</m> and then apply the gilded stamped ornament
on them with <m>strong glue</m>.</div></div><div id="p007r_2"><h2>For coloring stamped trunks</h2><div data-layout="middle">The stamp of <m>sheets of copper or latten</m> is made on engraved &amp; cut

<m><span>azur d’esmail</span></m>, &amp; soak in <m>turpentine varnish</m>.
