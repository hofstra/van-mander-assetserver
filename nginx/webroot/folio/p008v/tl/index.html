<m>☿</m> and then wipe your amalgam well &amp; make the
said <m>mercury</m> fly off. Next grind it on <span><m>marble</m></span>
with <m>gum water</m>. As for <m>silver</m> one needs to take it as
is &amp; eat away at it with <m><span>aqua
fortis</span></m>, then take it out with a <span><m>copper</m> blade</span>
&amp; rinse it thoroughly and next grind it with <m>gum water</m>.</div></div><div id="p008v_3"><h2>Polishing of <m>stones</m></h2><div data-layout="middle">There are three <span>wheels for doing this, one of <m>tin</m>, one of
<m>lead</m>, &amp; one of <m>fine copper</m></span>, on the
<s><span>cu</span></s> <span><m>copper</m> wheel</span> one does not
commonly cut <s><span>co</span></s> or polish but the <m>diamond</m>,
the <m>ruby</m>, <m>sapphire</m>, &amp; <m>oriental jacinth</m>. The
<span><m>tin</m> wheel</span> is for more tender stones like <m>emerald</m>,
<m>amethyst</m>, &amp; others.</div></div><div id="p008v_4"><h2>Mixture of <span>Pewterers</span> <s><span></span></s></h2><div data-layout="middle">Because among the <m>fine tin</m> they often mix well <span>half</span>
of <m>lead</m>, which renders the <m>tin</m> <span>deaf</span>. To correct
this, they mix in some <m>latten filings</m> to render it
<span>sonorous</span>.</div></div><div id="p008v_5"><h2>Perfect amalgam</h2><div data-layout="middle">Take the most delicate <span><m>stoneware</m> vessel</span> you can, with a cavity in
the middle. Put in an <span>eighth part</span> of <m>☿</m>
<s>in</s> &amp; while adding <m>water</m>, rub &amp; wear down your
<m>☾</m> or <m>☼</m> until the
substance becomes like paste &amp; even harder. Next, if you want, eat
it away with good <m><span>aquafortis</span></m>, if it is
<m>☾</m> or <m>♀</m>. Then remelt it,
having taken it out as you know. The <m>☾</m> will be
colored, and having been melted, will leave some grains of
<m>☼</m>, &amp; the <m>♀</m> will be
very fine &amp; will have almost no <span>chappe</span>.</div></div></folio></body></html>
