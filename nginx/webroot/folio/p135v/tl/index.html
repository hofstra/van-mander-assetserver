to put in it, coarsely pestle a little <m>borax</m> &amp; put it at the
bottom, then the <m>☼</m> on top. Arrange on the
<m>charcoals</m> of the <span>forge</span> the <span>crucible</span> in such a
way that the wind of the <span>bellows</span> blows on it from underneath
and not at the side, for this cools it &amp; does not heat it enough.
Make sure also that it is distanced three <span><span>fingers</span></span> from
the wall of the <span>forge</span>, in order that it can be surrounded with
<m>charcoal</m>. Let the said <span>crucible</span> reheat, until it is well
red. Then, make your <span>boy</span> blow on it with long and strong
pushes, for in this way it heats <s>well</s> better. And
nevertheless <s>blow by</s> when the <m>gold</m> is melted, blow on
top with a <span>little bellows</span>, for the <m>gold</m> will become
brittle &amp; take on a <span>chappe</span>. And as long as it makes a
swirling smoke, as you blow thus, it means that is not <span>doulx</span>
enough for the cast. Uncover therefore the <span>crucible</span> &amp;
without moving <s><span>ch</span></s> it from its place and without
interrupting the blowing, make it lean towards you in order to see well
inside. Throw in it the <span>size of a <span>bean</span></span> of <m>borax</m>
&amp; blow inside in jolts with the <span>little bellows</span>. But if
there is <m>charcoal</m> inside, blow a little stronger to make it go
out. And if the <m>gold</m> smokes &amp; swirls, put some more
<m>borax</m> in and <s>note</s> blow on top, making sure that, if it
is still brittle &amp; not softened enough, it does not cover itself
when you blow, as if it had cooled. But if it does not make this sign,
it is <span>douls</span> enough. @At that point blow very strongly in order
to heat it well, and as you think it is hot enough, throw in on top, in
the <span>crucible</span>, the<m> <def><m><span>couleur</span></m></def>
composed, as said beforehand here, of <m>verdet</m>, <m>saltpeter</m>,
<m>sal ammoniac</m> &amp; <m>borax</m></m>, <add>a little</add>. And
<s>let rest</s> blow always with the <span>small bellows</span>, and the
<m>gold</m> will become shiny like</div><div data-layout="left-middle">

If you cast in <m>gold</m> some important piece, <m>lute</m> your
<span>mold</span> with the same sand where <s>there is</s> there is some

If you want to cast some large work in <m>gold</m>, or which is
important, make at the foot of the <span>forge</span>, or at one end of it a
