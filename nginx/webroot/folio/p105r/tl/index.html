there cut a branch on which you see that, next to
<s><span>raci</span></s> the sprouting of leaves there are little
buttons that one calls <span>oeillets</span>, which are the beginnings of
sprouts. One needs to nimbly, with a <span>very sharp pen-knife</span>, cut
in the shape of a shield a little bit of the skin <s>with</s> which
contains an <span>oeillet</span> or sprout with the leaf, thus marked B.
<s>But</s> <s><span>plustot</span></s> Then carefully make on the
tender wood <s><span>s</span></s> which is full of sap, on which you
want to graft, two lines thus <s><span>de</span></s> cut <figure></figure>, then
make in the middle a cleft thus

. Next, separate with the point of the <span>pen-knife</span> the bark &amp;
open it from the cleft in the middle, and having neatly lodged your
shield so that nothing comes out but the sprout, bind it well &amp; wrap
it entirely with a <span><m>slip of <span>linen</span></m></span> or <span><m>very
soft thread</m></span>, so that there is nothing uncovered but the leaf,
which in three or 4 <span><span>days</span></span> will give you an indication
whether the shield should take, accordingly it will be green. Leave your
graft seven or eight <span><span>days</span></span> thus, then unbind it &amp;
join it well to the bark, especially at the sprout, &amp; then rebind
all gently but not as strongly as before; &amp; if there is any output
or growth, leave it space to go out; &amp; do thus three or 4
times.</div><div id="fig_p105r_1" data-layout="left-bottom"><img alt="" classname="inline-figure" src="/bnf-ms-fr-640/figures/p105r_1.png"></div><div><i>Continued...</i></div></div></folio></body></html>
