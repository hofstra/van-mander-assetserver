sun</span> or on its own, if it has eggs, they will shrink while drying
and will only be more beautiful. Therefore make your <span>slab of
<m>yellow <span>potter</span>â€™s earth</m></span>, like for other figures,
lay your <span>crayfish</span> on top, the <s><span>s</span></s> back
<s>on top</s> <add>on the bottom</add>, &amp; the legs, belly &amp;
eggs, which are all the most fanciful parts to mold, on the other side
and on the top. Push the back down in the <span><m>clay</m> slab</span>,
up to near the legs, which is about halfway. And fix the body with an
<span><m>iron wire</m> point</span> in the middle &amp; if it seems
necessary, another, at the end of the tail. And in order that the
<add>big</add> legs show themselves lower than the head, which is
<s><span>enf</span></s> half sunken, <corr>extend</corr> them &amp; from
underneath add to them a little <m>clay</m> to raise them. Hide also the
horns in the <m>clay</m>, under the big legs, to arrange them afterwards
as you like. As for small legs, extend them on the <m>clay</m>
until the joint, and the other half of the legs remain above, curved,
for the first cast. However, in order that they do not move &amp;
detach, secure them well, not only on the <m>clay</m>, but
<s><span>att</span></s> fix them with <m>wax</m> &amp; a <span>little hot
<m>iron</m></span> straight in the joints. And if you want to find the
most fanciful cast, you can attach the end of one of the legs with the
same <m>wax</m> on the body, or on one of the big legs, and aso make, if
it has eggs, the tail to be half folded on the eggs, &amp; fix it in
this form with an <span><m>iron wire</m> point</span>. Take special heed,
since the thing is <s><span>s</span></s> thus arranged, that it can be
well cleaned. Lastly, having rubbed the <span>crayfish</span> with
<m>eau-de-vie</m>, cast your sand. Having set, uncover the back of the
<span>crayfish</span>, the head &amp; the eyes &amp; its little pincers, the
big legs and the small legs all along, for one needs to uncover the most
that one can, both the long horns &amp; the tail, except if you have
folded &amp; curved it to hold the eggs. Other animals</div><div data-layout="left-middle">Secure what has detached,

<m>lake</m>, and the sides &amp; the belly &amp; underneath the legs is
of a carnation made of <m>vermilion</m>, <m>white of ceruse</m>, a
little <m>yellow ochre</m>. As in this &amp; all other things, have
always the natural thing in front of you to imitate it.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">Lay the horns on the big legs,
