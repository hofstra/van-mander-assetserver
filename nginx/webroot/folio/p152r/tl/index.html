cast, you can therefore shave them with fire, like <s><span>d</span></s>
the <span>tyrant of <span>Syracuse</span></span>,
&amp; afterwards you can replace them with <s><span>dâ€™arg</span></s>
<m>silver</m> nature-like ones. The tail is beautiful molded because it
is made of scaly circles, nearly like the one of a <span>lizard</span>,
&amp; in order that the hair does not hinder good molding, burn it in
the fire of a <span>little candle</span>. The rest of the body should be
anointed with <m><span>wheat</span> oil</m>, which will keep the hair rigid
&amp; couched, so that the sand will not raise it by getting entangled
in it, to prevent coming out neatly. The <m><span>wheat</span> oil</m> being
dry, which will be quick, you will be able to pass a <span>very thin
comb</span> to divide it, in order that it appears in the cast. On a
<span>small mouse</span>, you can even put some <m>common oil</m> to lower
the hair. And before molding these animals (except <span>snakes</span> &amp;
<span>lizards</span>), let them <s>rest</s> remain dead <span>one or two
<span>days</span></span>, to have them more handleable. For they stay rigid
after their death, &amp; cannot be well fitted to their true shape until
they are a little softened. However, if you mold it quickly after it is
dead, or give it its shape before it stiffens, you will do well.
<s><span>Au</span></s> And because the eyes die, <s>you there
some</s> if you do not mold it promptly, you will be able to
substitute, in the eyes, the <m>halves of well-rounded
<span>peas</span></m>, stripped of their skin &amp; shell. Some make the
<span>rat</span> <corr>shed</corr>, others anoint it with <m><span>olive</span>
oil</m>, which is amiable, for <m><span>wheat</span> oil</m> is thick &amp;
has too much body. This is why one scarcely uses it, only to give some
feature to a <span>fly</span> foot or under a wing to keep them rigid.
Others couch the <corr>hair</corr> with an <m>egg yolk</m>, which is
quickly dry &amp; amiable. Shape it, before <m>oiling</m> it, on the
<span><m>clay</m> slab</span>, and raise its head with an <span><m>iron</m>
point</span> &amp; secure also the feet with points &amp; the tail. Rub it
with <m>eau-de-vie</m>, once dry from the <m>oil</m>. Then cast your
sand, next uncover it like other animals, &amp; make the second cast.
One ought not to open the <span>mold</span> until it is reheated &amp; the
<span>rat</span> burned.</div><div data-layout="left-middle"><mark>+</mark>

The <span>rat</span>, because it is thick, comes out better being hollow, if
it is a <span>big rat</span>. A <span>mouse</span> molds better, because it has
shorter hair. It is not possible to mold well an animal that has
<m>biggish bones</m>, like a <span>bird</span> or <span>rat</span>, without
opening the <span>mold</span> to clean it well, for <m>bones</m> do not
calcine at all.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">All feathers &amp; all hair is awkward
to mold in accordance with its nature.</div><div data-layout="left-middle"><m>Butter</m> for anointing hairy animals
is better <s><span>e</span></s> than <m><span>wheat</span> oil</m>, because
it is more amiable.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">If the <span>rat</span> is big, it is good
to remove its entrails, or having molded it, to dry it in the
<span>oven</span>, because the large amount of moisture that it has comes to
boil in the <span>mold</span>, &amp; spoils it &amp; makes lumps.</div><div data-layout="left-middle">Do not put your <span>mold</span> <span>in
the cold</span> until it has slowly cooled dry. Otherwise it imbibes the
humidity, which makes it break.</div></div></folio></body></html>
