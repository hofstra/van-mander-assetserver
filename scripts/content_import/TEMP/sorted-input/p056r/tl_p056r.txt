<head>Excellent tempering bath for the body of cuirasses</head>

<ab>Take <m><env>river</env> water</m>, as clear &amp; running as
possible, &amp; heat it to a little more than tepid. Then take a bunch
of <m><pa>weld</pa></m>, &amp; take the grain of it &amp; put it into
the said <m>water</m> &amp; boil<comment>c_056r_01</comment> it
thoroughly, stirring it with a <tl>stick</tl>, then pour it into a
<tl>muid</tl> or other <tl>vessel</tl>, then throw into it two
<ms>pecks</ms> of <m>salt</m>. </ab>

<ab>Next, take a <ms><tl>big cauldron</tl> of the said
<m><env>river</env> water</m></ms> &amp; heat it to a litte more than
tepid. &amp; take three or four <ms>double <bp>handfuls</bp></ms> of
<m>fatty red earth</m>, wet it &amp; throw it into the <tl>cauldron</tl>
with the said <m>water</m>. Take <ms>as much <m><al>pigeon</al> dung</m>
as the said <m>earth</m></ms>, &amp; <ms>as much <m><al>horse</al>
dung</m></ms> &amp; <ms>as much <m>iron filings</m></ms>. &amp; wet the
whole separately, &amp; throw it into the <tl>cauldron</tl> &amp; leave
it for two or three <ms><tmp>days</tmp></ms>. Then throw it afterwards
into the said <tl>muid</tl> and stir the whole thoroughly together. And
the older this tempering bath is, the better it will be.</ab>

<head><m>Varnish</m> for <m>distemper</m></head>

<ab>You can make <m>marble</m> by <m>distemper</m> from <m>lake</m> or
<m>rose of <pl>Ghent</pl></m> &amp; <m>chalk</m>. Once dry, glaze with
<m>lake</m> mixed in <m>wine</m>, for the <m>glue</m> makes it die &amp;
blacken. And all will afterwards appear red, but the <m>varnish</m> you will
put here, which will penetrate, will make dark &amp; light parts appear
as they ought to be. The <m>varnish</m> is made thus, mix with <m>clear
<pl>Venice</pl> turpentine</m> some <m><pa>spike lavender</pa> oil</m>
<del>&amp;</del> until all is clear &amp; liquid enough, &amp;it is done
without fire. This one <del><fr>es</fr></del> is for things in
<m>distemper</m>, and the <m>turpentine varnish</m> that you know, for
panels. <m>Pure <pa>spike lavender</pa> oil varnish</m> is not good for
panels, for <m><pa>spike lavender</pa> oil</m> is too penetrating &amp;
makes colours sparkle, unless it was made long ago.</ab>
