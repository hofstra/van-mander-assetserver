<head><m>Sal ammoniac</m> and <m>iron dross</m></head>

<ab>I have pulverized <m>sal ammoniac</m>, well dried in the fire &amp;
in a hot <tl><m>bronze</m> mortar</tl>, and passed it through the
<tl>double sieve</tl>, it became very fine. But to render it even
thinner, I have crushed it dry on <tl><m>porphyry</m></tl>. Then I mixed
it with <m>pulverized &amp; finely ground iron dross</m>, in the same
way, and both mold very neatly things in low relief, without being
moistened <env>in the <tmp><fr>serain</fr></tmp></env>, or in the
<env>cellar</env>, or otherwise with the <tl>napkin</tl>, &amp; it
releases very neatly.</ab>

<ab><pro>Molders</pro> from <pl>Foix</pl> who cast their medals crosswise,<comment>c_090r_02</comment> use <m><la>crocum ferri</la></m> and <m>calcined slate</m>. It is
for very flat things.</ab>

<head>All sands can be rendered good</head>

<ab><pro>Artisans who work in big works</pro>, &amp; who need to further
their profit, by seeking things already prepared in nature, because it
does not sell its wares to people, and to also save the time they would
use for grinding finely &amp; for artificially preparing sands, seek
<m>the one of the <del><fr>s</fr></del> <env>mine</env><del>s</del></m>,
which is not too fat, having some <m>earth</m> in it, not too lean &amp;
consequently without bond, but rather which is pulled <env>from the
depths of the sand-bed</env> in <fr>mattons</fr> &amp; clods that show
its natural compactness, which is quite difficult to break &amp; which
has a very small &amp; delicate grain, &amp; which is found <sn>soft
when handling it between your <tl><bp>fingers</bp></tl></sn>. And
because the latter is only found <env>near the rocks in mountainous
areas</env>, or <env>lean territories</env> &amp; having
<m><fr>arene</fr></m>, it cannot be found <del>in</del> <env>in the
surroundings of all the <pl><fr>bonnes villes</fr></pl></env>,<comment>c_028v_02</comment> where
<pro>artisans</pro> willingly gather themselves. And thus, if they do
not have it <env>close to their house</env>, they prefer to have it come
from afar, like from <pl>Lyon</pl>, <pl>Venise</pl>, <pl>Parys near the
Sainct Chappelle</pl> &amp; similar places, rather than prepare it.
However, you can be certain that in all places you can render the
<m>sand from a <env>quarry</env></m>.</ab>
