<ab>When you are making a painting with several persons, just as the
flesh colors have to be different, so do the shadows.</ab></div>

<head>In fresco</head>

<ab><m>Azure</m> is not good here, but bleak, &amp; one needs to work
with long <tl><fr> longs pinceaux</fr></tl>. Fresco is not used

<ab><m>Turpentine oil</m> renders it very beautiful. Assay <m><la>palma
christi</la><comment>c_058v_01</comment> seed oil</m>.
<m><pa>Walnut</pa> oil</m> in <pl>Flanders</pl> costs at least a hundred
<cn>sols</cn> a <ms>pint</ms>. The <m>azure</m> requires a little
<m>fatty oil</m> because it has no body.</ab>

<m><fr>Azur dâ€™esmail</fr></m> hates more than any other to be ground,
especially with <m>water</m>, for it dies &amp; loses all its color.
However, because it cannot be worked if it is coarse, grind not with
<m>water</m> but with <m>oil</m> &amp; grind it coarsely, and in this
way it will not die as much.</ab>

<head><tl><fr>Pinceaulx</fr></tl></head>

<ab>When the color has dried inside, &amp; you want to clean them, soak
them in <m><pa>spike lavender</pa> oil</m> and they immediately will
turn soft again as before, then you will finish to clean them in some
<m><pa>walnut</pa> oil</m>. <m><pa>Walnut</pa> oil</m>is not <del>as
not</del> as appropriate to soften them as the <m><pa>spike
lavender</pa></m> kind which is clear like <m>water</m> &amp; penetrates
&amp; does not have body like <m><pa>walnut</pa> oil</m>. The <tl>handle
of <fr>pinceaulx</fr></tl> is made by those who work with
care<comment>c_058v_02</comment> from <m><al>porcupine</al> quills</m>,
by others from <m><m>wood</m> of arrows from<pl>Turkey</pl></m>
<del>with whom</del> with which they also make <tl>small rods to rest
their <bp>hand</bp> when they are painting</tl>.</ab>

To work well on a small scale very thin <tl><fr>pinceaulx</fr> which
have a firm point</tl> <corr>are</corr> needed. And because the <m>hair
taken from the tail of a<al>squirrel</al>'s fur</m> is <fr>soft</fr>,
the most careful take the <m>bristles of the oldest <al>rats</al></m>,
especially of <al>dormice</al> if they can find them, &amp; put two or
three of them in the middle of the <tl><fr>pinceau</fr></tl>. These make
a straight line like a <tl><m>quill</m></tl> &amp; all the other
<m>hairs</m> of the <tl><fr>pinceau</fr></tl> stick to them as to the
point. The <m>bristles of <al>stone martens</al> &amp; <al>weasels</al>
&amp; small animals that make <m>musk</m></m> are even better, for a
single<m>hair</m> in a <tl><fr>pinceau</fr></tl> suffices.</ab>
