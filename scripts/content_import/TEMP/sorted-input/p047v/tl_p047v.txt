<ab>Some, to make it run neatly, put <ms>half</ms> <m>metal</m> &amp;
<ms>half</ms> <m>copper</m>. Others take one <ms>part</ms> of
<m>potin</m> &amp; one <ms>part</ms> of <del><m>copper</m></del>
<m>latten</m>. Others take one <ms>part</ms> of <m>candlestick
latten</m> &amp; one <ms>part</ms> of <m>basin latten</m>. And among
basins, the <m>latten</m> of larger ones is more brittle than that of
skillets, because in order to make the round shape so small it is
necessary that the substance be softer. For big ones which have a more
ample round shape, a more brittle substance can be taken. In any event,
the most brittle <m>latten</m> runs better, &amp; casts more neatly, but
it must be cast very <del>neat</del> hot. <del>One</del> When one wants
to cast, one casts <m>lead</m> into the substance, which makes it flow
&amp; run &amp; goes up in smoke, &amp; keeps the <tl>mold</tl> from
corrupting. And if you want to cast fire pieces, mix in more
<m>rosette</m> than <m>latten</m>, so that it is less breakable. The
<tl>crucibles for melting <m>metal</m></tl> should be better than
<tl>those for <pro>glassmakers</pro></tl> for <m>glass</m> is not as
heavy as <m>metal</m>. And in this instance, one needs to <m>lute</m> the
<tl>crucibles</tl> with <m>earth</m> and <m><tl>pestled</tl> glass</m>.</ab>

<ab>Finely <m>calcinated pumice stone</m> casts 22 <ms>carat</ms>
<m>gold</m> without repair, but it needs to be ablaze and red like the
<m>metal</m>. And it withstands several casts.</ab>
