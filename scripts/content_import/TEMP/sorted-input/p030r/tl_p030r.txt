<ab>The best, fattest &amp; softest is brought from <pl>Germany</pl> and
is not in <fr>saulmon</fr>,<comment>c_028v_04</comment> but in <fr>lattes</fr>, of around an
<ms><bp>arm</bp></ms> long &amp; three <ms><bp>fingers</bp></ms> wide.
It is transported to <pl>Lyon</pl>, and from this, the leaf is made for
small mirrors in <pl>Nuremberg</pl>.</ab>

<ab>They also make their <tl>molds</tl> out of <m>metal</m> which last
longer &amp; mold more cleanly than <m><fr>grais</fr></m>,<comment>c_030r_03</comment> because the
plate comes out without flashing &amp; smooth. But this is for the

<pro>rich</pro> because a <tl>mold</tl> costs fifteen or sixteen
<cn>frans</cn>. They are mainly made of <m>metal</m>, for basins &amp;
ewers &amp; salt cellars &amp; similar things which are fashioned.</ab>

<ab>For pints<comment>c_030r_01</comment>, <tl>molds</tl> are made with
<m>white clay earth</m> mixed with <m><al>horse</al> dung</m> &amp; <m>cloth
waste</m> &amp; well beaten, because the pints, being deep half-circles,
would not easily release from the <tl><m><fr>grais</fr></m> mold</tl>,
unlike the <m>earth</m> ones, which are
soft. One makes the <fr>noyau</fr> of the <tl>mold</tl> of the said
pints in <fr>grais</fr>.</ab>

<ab>In <tl>metal molds</tl>, one makes vents and casts all at once,
which is the cause that in the middle of the dish, no smoky black line
which comes from the vapor &amp; smoke of the <m>metal</m> that is cast,
which is the cause that in that spot, the work is lumpy &amp; very often
pierced. However they repair it with <m>solder</m> <del><fr>du
n</fr></del>, as is said. This smoke is made right in the middle of the
cast, &amp; in <tl> molds of <m><fr>grais</fr></m></tl>.</ab>

<ab>The plate can be <tl>hammered</tl> <del><fr>mar</fr></del> to make
it more vendable. But it will not last as long.</ab>

<ab>Depending on the size of their platters &amp; plates, they have
notches on the spoke of their <tl><m>iron</m> wheels</tl>. And when they
want to apply</ab>
