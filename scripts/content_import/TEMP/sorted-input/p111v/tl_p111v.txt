<ab>The <ms>size of two <m><pa>chestnuts</pa></m></ms> of <m>pulverized
sal ammoniac</m> suffices in a <ms><tl>pot</tl></ms> of <m>water</m>,
and <sn>to the <tl><bp>tongue</bp></tl> you find the <m>water</m>
moderately <m>salty</m></sn>, for too much is not good.</ab>

<ab>To clean the various colors of <m>lead</m> &amp; <m>tin</m>, one
pulverizes <m>sanguine</m> &amp; with some <tl>cloths</tl>, one rubs the

<head><al>Lizards</al></head>

<ab>When one takes them with two <tl><bp>fingers</bp></tl> from the
sides of the head, at the level of the ears, one makes them open their
<del><fr>g</fr></del> mouth, then one takes the <del><fr>a</fr></del>
end of its lower mandible, <add>with the end of the
<tl><bp>fingernail</bp></tl></add>, &amp; next, with the upper mandible,
it bites the <tl><bp>nail</bp></tl>, but it cannot pass through, but it
bites very well. And if it were to bite living <bp>flesh</bp> it would
<del><fr>au</fr></del> not let go, &amp; there would be no better remedy
than to promptly cut off his head. <tmp>In the spring</tmp>, as they
have changed skin, they are more beautiful.</ab>

The small <al>lizards</al> that one takes in the <tmp>summer</tmp>, the
size of small <al>female lizards</al>, grey on the back &amp; green on
the belly, are very appropriate to cast in <m>silver</m>, &amp;
<m>gold</m>, or other <m>metal</m>, because their have rougher scales
than the of <al>female lizards</al> &amp; show better.

<head>Composition of sand</head>

<ab>Everything once reheated as it said here above, take four 4 full
<ms><tl>crucibles</tl></ms> of <m>plaster</m>, two 2 of <m>brick</m>,
&amp; one of <m><fr>alum de plume</fr></m>. Do not pass through the
<tl>sieve</tl> to mix, <del><fr>may</fr></del> because the
<m><fr>alum</fr></m> would not pass. Mix with your
<tl><bp>hands</bp></tl>, until neither one nor the other, neither white
nor red, is recognised among the other. If your <m>plaster</m> was not
strong, do not mix at all so much <m><fr>alum de plume</fr></m>, because
it softens the <tl>molds</tl>. Take head also that your sand is not hot
(since it has immediately been reheated) <del><fr>C</fr></del> when you
will want to mix it with <m>water</m>, for this <del><fr>les</fr></del>
makes <tl>molds</tl> too soft &amp; breakable.

</ab>

<ab>

<margin>left-bottom</margin>

You may sometimes diminish the quantity of <m>plaster</m> if you do not
find it strong enough to withstand fire &amp; if it cracks,
<del>&amp;</del> in order that the part of <m><tl>pestled</tl> tiles</m> holds up, with
the <m><fr>alum de plume</fr></m>, which you can also increase so that
it creates a better bond.</ab>
