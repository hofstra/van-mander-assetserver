<head>Casting in <m>gold</m></head>

<ab>To cast in <m>gold</m>, <del><fr>il f</fr></del> <m><la>crocum
ferri</la></m> is necessary, <add>&amp; more <m><fr>alum de
plume</fr></m> than in the following mixture. The <m><fr>alum de
plume</fr></m> mixture cannot corrupt anything. The <tl>mold</tl> needs
to be red &amp; one needs to press it promptly with <tl><m>iron</m>
presses</tl>.</add></ab>

<ab>The <m>shell of <al>crabs</al> &amp; <al>crayfish</al></m> are
uneasy to burn &amp; there is a proper fashion of molding them.</ab>

<ab><al>Rats</al> &amp; <al>birds</al> can be molded, and the feet are
uneasy to extract, when burnt, because they are small &amp; delicate.
The bodies are extracted more easily from the <tl>mold</tl>. The feet
are cast in many <del>times</del> pieces.</ab>

<ab><rub><m>Tiles</m></rub></ab>

<ab>
<margin>right-middle</margin>
<add>Those of the <env>houses</env> that are not sandy seem to withstand
fire better.</add></ab>

<ab><m>Tiles</m> with which one covers <env>houses</env>, the hardest
&amp; firmest, and purged of <m>stones</m> &amp; coarse <m>gravel</m>,
are used to <del><fr>p</fr></del> mix in with the sand
<del><fr>et</fr></del> for molding. But, before, it is necessary to heat
them just until they have been well red for one or two
<ms><tmp>hours</tmp></ms>, &amp; pestle them &amp; pass them finely
through a <tl>sieve</tl>.</ab>

<ab>The little <al>turtles</al>, having just come out of the egg, are
very nice to mold.<comment>c_106v_02</comment></ab>

<ab>
<add>If the <m>plaster</m> is mixed with some <m>dust</m> or is not the
hard kind, it bursts in the fire &amp; causes flashing.</add></ab>

<ab><rub>The hardest <m>plaster</m></rub>, as was said, is the best
being from <m>stone</m>, therefore take it raw of this kind. Pestle it
<del><fr>bien</fr></del><add><fr>plus</fr></add> as finely as possible
and pass it through the finest <tl>sieve</tl> or <tl>sleeve</tl> that
you can. Being thus <del><fr>p</fr></del><add>b</add> fine, put it,
<add>in a <ms>good amount</ms></add>, in a <tl>cauldron</tl> or
<tl>skillet</tl> over an open flame, &amp; as it begins to heat up, stir
it continuously, and heavy &amp; coarse as it is, it will become so light
&amp; so handleable that it will seem to you not to have any resistance
to <del>handling</del><add>stirring</add>, as if it was <m>water</m>.
Keep stirring it continuously until it returns once again to being heavy
&amp; dense, and that is the sign that it is cooked. <add>But do not reheat
it until your <m>brick</m> and <m><fr>alum de plume</fr></m> are
reheated &amp; your <m>clay</m> circles are done. For it needs to be the
last one reheated &amp; when all the rest is ready, for the less
<m>plaster</m><mark>#</mark></add></ab>

<ab>
<margin>left-bottom</margin>
<mark>#</mark> remains reheated, &amp; <del><fr>plus</fr></del> the
quickest it is put to use, that is the best, for it sets more quickly.
One ought not reheat it until you want to mold. And to reheat it, put
it, as finely ground raw powder, in a <tl>cauldron</tl> on
<del>ash</del> a clear flame &amp; do not make it neither too strong nor
too violent. Always stir with a long <tl>stick</tl>, to avoid the vapor,
turning it around the <tl>cauldron</tl> &amp; in the middle, in a figure
8. At the beginning, you will find it heavy <del>difficult</del> to
stir, because it is full of moisture. As it heats up, it will start to
throw off some bubbles at the edge of the <tl>cauldron</tl>. And finally
it will become like liquid &amp; as it were mealy &amp; like bran &amp; boiling in
the middle. Continue to stir continuously until you recognize that it
has once again become heavy

<ab><rub><m><fr>Alum de plume</fr></m></rub> is the one that gives good
binding to sand.</ab>

<ab><rub><m><la>Crocum ferri</la></m></rub> is appropriate for
<m>gold</m>. It is it, once mixed within the sand, that receives it
&amp; holds it within its warmth.<comment>c_106v_04</comment></ab>

When you have it as a <m>stone</m>, choose the hardest bits and those
which do not easily crumble away with your <tl><bp>nail</bp></tl>, and
clean it well from powder &amp; filth before pestling it.</ab>

<ab>
<margin>left-middle</margin>
<m>Plaster</m> alone does not withstand fire, but breaks up into pieces.

Reheated <m>plaster</m><del><fr>se ga</fr></del>, as is said here, keeps
well one or two <ms><tmp>months</tmp></ms> well pressed <env>in a dry
place</env>, if it's not <tmp><env>rainy weather</env></tmp>. But when
fresh, it is excellent for exquisite work.

It must withstand the fire &amp; turn red like a lit
<m>charcoal</m>.</ab>
