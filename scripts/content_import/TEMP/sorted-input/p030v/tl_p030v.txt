<ab>any dish or plate, they loosen &amp; undo with the strike of a
<tl>hammer</tl> the <m>iron</m> wedges that slide along the spokes of
the <tl>wheel</tl>. And, when they are at the notch and points that they
need, they tighten the said wedges, striking them with the
<tl>hammer</tl>.</ab>

<ab>When their plates or dishes have been cast, soldered if needed,
&amp; purged of surrounding flashing with the hot <tl>soldering
iron</tl> &amp; then with a large <tl>file</tl>, they adapt it on the
<tl>wheel</tl>; &amp; first of all they wrap their
<del><tl><fr>desgrusoue</fr></tl></del> <tl><fr>desgrusouer</fr></tl>
with a <tl>rope</tl>, as thick <corr><del><tl>rope</tl></del></corr> as
the <ms><bp>little finger</bp></ms>, &amp; lean it firmly on the
<tl>crossbar</tl> to secure it well. And while someone else promptly
turns the <tl>wheel</tl>, they guide the sharp edge of the
<tl><fr>esgrusouer</fr></tl> by <tl><bp>hand</bp></tl>
<del><fr>s</fr></del> towards the edge of the round cavity, &amp; gently
guide it to the center of the circle. And this
<tl><fr>desgrusouer</fr></tl> is for removing the first rough &amp;
lumpy skins of the work. And next they even it out with a <tl>cutting
<m>iron</m></tl> called a <tl><fr>plane</fr></tl>, on which they rub the
sharp edge with a little <m>putty</m>, on <m>leather</m> <tl>nailed</tl>
onto a piece of <m>wood</m> <del>having</del>, and this, in such a way
that the flesh or grain is on the outside, for if the sharp edge of this
<tl><fr>plane</fr></tl> was not thus rubbed &amp; burnished, it would
not polish &amp; <del>not</del>burnish the <m>tin</m>,
<del><fr>au</fr></del> which would stay white, &amp; not black &amp;
polished like a mirror. Moreover, they repair the work for the second
time with this <tl><fr>plane</fr></tl> as they did with the
<tl><fr>esgrusouer</fr></tl>. Then, with a <tl>knife</tl> or another
<tl>sharp <m>iron</m></tl>, they scrape the edges of the platters or
plates to smooth them so that they are not found sharp when handled</ab>
