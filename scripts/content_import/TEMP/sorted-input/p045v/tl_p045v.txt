<head>Loading an arquebus</head>

<ab>You ought to have different charges according to the range that you
want to give to your arquebus, all of which should have a <tl>screw</tl>
on the end that fits in the <tl>nut</tl> of the <tl>ramrod</tl> of the
said arquebus. Thus, when you have put the <m>powder</m> in the charge,
which is in the <tl>nut</tl>, hold the <tl>ramrod</tl> upright. And
raising your arquebus up, insert the said <tl>ramrod</tl> until the
charge is at the bottom of the arquebus, then right the arquebus, the
mouth of the barrel up, and remove the <tl>little ramrod</tl>. Thus your
<m>powder</m> will be entirely in the breech without any of its grain or
dust attaching to the sides of the arquebus, which always has some filth
in the chamber. Thus it will not push back, and you will shoot more
true.</ab>

<head>For adjusting a crooked cannon</head>

<ab>Take off the breech and place it on an <tl>smooth &amp; well-leveled
table</tl> and pass through the inside a <tl>very smooth string without
knots</tl>, on each end of which there should be a <tl>plumb</tl>
hanging from each side. Then look into the barrel along the
<tl>string</tl>, and if it does not touch equally all over, note the
place where it does not touch &amp; hit with a hammer on the outside on
that side &amp; in the same place, &amp; thus it will be righted, &amp;
do thus all the way round.</ab>
