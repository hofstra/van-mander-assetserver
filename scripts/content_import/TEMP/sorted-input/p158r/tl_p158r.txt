<head><m>Mercury</m> in the <tl>molds</tl> for cleaning</head>

<ab>

Heed well that your <tl>mold</tl> be quite cold before blowing to make
the <m>ash</m> go out, and next put in the <m>☿</m> to
achieve the cleaning. For if the <tl>mold</tl> is hot, the
<m>☿</m> penetrates within &amp; in flight, seeks out
conduits &amp; leaves an <sn>odor of itself</sn>, which sours the
<m>tin</m> or other <m>metal</m> that you will cast there so much that
it will break if it touches it even slightly. The heat of the
<tl>mold</tl> also retains <m>small grains of ☿</m>
that make lumps &amp; contracting to the edge of the molded leaves, are
joined there &amp; make the leaves frangible. The
<m>☿</m> cleans the <m>ash</m> well, especially flat
things where there are not delicate tracks which could be broken by its
weight. And thus, if you can cast neatly without putting it in, do not
use it. But if it is necessxary to use it, mix your sand with
<m><la>crocum</la></m> in order that it withstands the fire well. And
after having put in the <m>☿</m>, evacuate it, turning
the mouth of the <tl>mold</tl> to the bottom. Next, reheat the
<tl>mold</tl> gently in order that the <m>☿</m> is gone
from everywhere. In this way I have cast a branch of
<pl>periwinkle</pl>, leaves &amp; flowers, very neatly, having on the
flower a branch of <ill/> melted on the back of the flower <ill/></ab>

Reheat the <tl>mold</tl> very red before <del>q</del> casting in it, in
order that the <m>☿</m> exhales well.</ab>
