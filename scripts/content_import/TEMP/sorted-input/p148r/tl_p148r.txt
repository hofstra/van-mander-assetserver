<ab>come out as clear as I wanted. I reheated it again, let it cool,
placed it again to be whitened &amp; rubbed with a
<tl>scratch-brush</tl>. It came out very neatly. You will do thus for
<m>copper</m> and <m>silver</m>. And if you want to

<ab>Having cleaned it well, as is said, &amp; <tl>wire-brushed</tl> it
well, make it boil in <m>water</m> &amp; <m><pa>turmeric root</pa></m>
or <m><pa><fr>terra merita</fr></pa></m>, and it will become very
beautiful.</ab>

<ab>If it is for <m>silver</m>, do not pestle your <m>tartar</m> with
<m>iron</m>, but with the <tl>handle of a hammer</tl>, for if you touch
&amp; dip <m>iron</m> in your <m>whitening</m>, the <m>silver</m> would
become red like <m>copper</m> &amp; you would need to reheat it &amp;
put it again in <m>whitening</m>. Mix nothing with your <m>tartar</m>
that should not enter the <m>whitening</m>, for this corrupts it. Do not
let it spill out of its first boil, for in this is all its strength. The
<m>whitening</m> is made with one <ms>part</ms> <m>pulverized tartar</m>
&amp; a <ms>half</ms> of <m>common salt</m>.</ab>

<ab>One usually molds the foot &amp; the leg up to the joint. And for
this effect, one molds it in five pieces: the leg in two pieces, the top
of the foot in two, and the bottom in one piece.</ab>

<ab>To make this quickly, redden the <m>filings</m> in an
<tl><m>iron</m> case</tl>, stirring it often. Then sprinkle it with
<m>good vinegar</m> &amp; let it evaporate &amp; without removing it
from atop the fire, let it redden &amp; inflame. Once cooled, pulverise
it on the <tl><m>marble</m></tl> &amp; return it to the fire,
<del><fr>rou</fr></del> sprinkle with <m>vinegar</m>, and then inflame.
Thus it will quickly be colored &amp; made fine.</ab>
