<head><m>Sand from <env>river</env> <al>tellins</al> and
<al>mussels</al></m></head>

<ab> The long <m><al>shells</al></m> that can be found in <env>fresh
river waters</env>, once calcined, makes an impalpable white sand, which
molds very neatly.</ab>

<head>Congealing <m>mercury</m></head>

<ab>It congeals, just as I tried, by boiling it one or two
<ms><tmp>hours</tmp></ms> in a rather large <tl><m>iron</m> posnet</tl>,
putting in, for an <ms>℥</ms> of
<m>☿</m>, ii <ms>℥</ms> of
<m><fr>verdet</fr></m> <del><fr>de</fr></del> and <m>vitriol of
saltpetre</m>, <ms><gk>ana</gk></ms>, with sufficient quantity of <m>old
water from <pro><fr>mareschaulx</fr></pro></m>.</ab>

<ab>Or else, melt 4 <ms>℥</ms> of <m>tin</m>, &amp; as
it cools, purify it of its <m>filth</m>, which is on top, then, make a
hole in it &amp; put in there i <ms>℥</ms> of
<m>☿</m> &amp; it will come out like <m>tin</m> if you
remelt it, but it will be breakable. And If you want to assay if it is
<m>tin</m> or <m>☿</m>, redden a <tl>shovel</tl> &amp;
put a small lump of your ingot on top. If it is <m>tin</m>, it will melt
&amp; stay, but if it is <m>☿</m>, will quickly melt,
then when crackling well, it will evaporate. One ought to congeal it in
a <tl>spoon</tl> or in a <tl>hollow crucible</tl>, &amp; make a
moderately sized hole.</ab>

<ab>It can also be congealed, as I assayed, in <m><la>aqua
fortis</la></m> which beforehand will have eaten a little <m>silver</m>.
This one, mixed, makes <m>tin</m> &amp; <m>lead</m> run.</ab>

<head>Mixture</head>

<ab><m>Fine tin</m>, <m>congealed mercury</m> with the smell of
<m>tin</m>, <m>looking glass tin</m>, <m>fine lead</m>, <ms>as much of
one as the other</ms>, makes a substance that melts very promptly, but
breakable &amp; white. I think that it would be good for <m>solder</m>.
A long time to cool.</ab>
