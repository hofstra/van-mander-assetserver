<head>White bronzing on <m>plaster</m></head>

<ab>One needs to give four layers of <pro>painters</pro>' <m>glue</m> in
distemper on the <m>plaster</m> portrait, always leaving each layer to
dry. Next, with <m>mine d’<pl>Angleterre</pl></m> ground on a marble, or
burnt <m>lead</m>, grind <del>av</del> &amp; distemper with a bit of
<m>gum</m> or <del><fr>go</fr></del> <m>glue</m>, lay down lightly. Once
dry, rub lightly with a little <m>cotton</m> and the <m>plaster</m>
portrait will seem to be of <m>lead</m>. Others grind <m>minium</m> with
<m>quicksilver</m>.</ab>

<head><m>Purpurine</m></head>

<ab>The soft <m>tin</m>, <ms>half an ounce</ms> of, melt it in a
<tl>spoon</tl>. Once melted, throw in an <ms>℥</ms> of <m>☿</m>, mix
together. Once cold, grind on <m>porphyry</m>. Next take an <ms>℥</ms>
of <m>sal ammoniac</m>, an <ms>℥</ms> of <m>sulfur</m>, the yellowest
that may be found, grind both of them. And then mix very well all the
aforementioned materials. Next put all together into a <del><it>a
pignatta</it></del> <tl><m>glass</m> sublimatorium</tl>, hold this over
a small fire for an <ms><tmp>hour</tmp></ms> &amp; for an
<ms><tmp>hour</tmp></ms> over a stronger one &amp; for an
<ms><tmp>hour</tmp></ms> over a very strong fire, and it will be done.
Next, to use it, apply <m>soot black</m> with the <m>glue</m> that
<pro>painters</pro> use to paint, <del>&amp;</del> two or three times,
until it is quite black. Next apply a little <m>varnish</m>. Once dry,
apply the <m>purpurine</m> a secco with a <tl><bp>finger</bp></tl> where
you want. The more you apply, the more beautiful it will be. Next, if
you want, apply <m>varnish</m> on top.</ab>

<ab>Apply black with <m>glue</m>, as was said, on the medal, then

d'<pl>Angleterre</pl></fr></m> on top with a <tl><fr>pinceau</fr></tl>
or a <tl><bp>finger</bp></tl>. The said grated <m><fr>mine</fr></m>
embellishes <m>lead</m> medals.</ab>
