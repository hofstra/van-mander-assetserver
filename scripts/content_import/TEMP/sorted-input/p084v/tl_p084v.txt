<ab>I tried the <m>bone of oxen <add>feet</add>, very burned &amp;
pulverized</m> &amp; ground on <tl><m>porphyry</m></tl>, until it <sn>is
not felt between your <tl><bp>fingers</bp></tl></sn>. It molds on its
own very neatly. But because on its own it is very arid &amp; lean, it
wants to be well moistened &amp; dampened with <m>wine boiled with
<pa>elm</pa> root</m>.</ab>

<ab><m>Iron dross</m>, <m>well burned bone of <al>oxen</al> feet</m>,
<m>felt also well burned</m> over a closed fire, and all three very well
ground on <tl><m>porphyry</m></tl> mold very neatly in <m>lead</m>,
without needing to be reheated a lot, &amp; casting
<del><fr>le</fr></del> <add>in a</add> hot or cold <tl>frame</tl>.</ab>

<ab><m>Felt</m> alone molds very neatly once moistened &amp; releases
well, and also makes the other two release.</ab>

These sands only withstand one casting.</ab>

<ab>
<margin>left-middle</margin>
A <m>fat sand</m> which is rendered very smooth, makes it porous.</ab>

<ab>A <m>fat metal</m> needs <m>lean sand</m>.</ab>

<ab>Some people think that <m>salt water</m> is not good, because the
<m>salt</m> cracks in fire, &amp; consequently should make it porous. a
result causes bubbles. There is only <m>wine boiled with <pa>elm</pa>
root</m>.</ab>

<ab><m>Charcoal for <fr>poncer</fr></m> makes for a good release, but
one finds <m>the one of <pa>willow</pa></m> make it porous. <m>The one
of <pa>oak</pa> or <pa>beech</pa></m> does well without making it
porous.</ab>

Try <m>burnt <al>oysters</al></m>.</ab>

<head><m>Lead</m></head>

<ab>For casting, there is only <m>soft lead</m> that wants to be cast
very <del><fr>g</fr></del> hot, and <m>soft tin</m>.</ab>

<head>Sand for <m>lead</m>, the most excellent of all, for high and low
reliefs</head>

<ab> I took <m>ceruse</m> and crushed it dry on
<tl><m>porphyry</m></tl>, to make it very fine, then I moistened so
much, with <m>well-beaten glair of egg</m>, that it was like a paste,
smoothing it perfectly with the dull side of a <tl>knife</tl>. I left it
a little. </ab>

One ought to mix it well with a <tl>knife</tl>.</ab>
