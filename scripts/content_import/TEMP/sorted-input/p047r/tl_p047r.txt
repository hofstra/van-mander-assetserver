as soon as you touch the tooth with, the tartar &amp; blackness will go
away. It is true that it has a <sn>bad odor</sn>, but you can mix it
with <m>rose honey</m> &amp; a little <m><pa>cinnamon</pa> or

<head>Crucibles</head>

<ab>Those from <pl>Bayonne</pl>, which seem to be made of
<m><fr>grès</fr></m><comment>c_047r_02</comment> are better, for they last, without comparison,
longer than others. And because they are not very thick, one wastes less
<m>charcoal</m> melting <m>gold</m> &amp; <m>silver</m>, for they heat
quickly. They do not absorb as much <m>silver</m> as much as the others,
&amp; for this reason, there is not much <m><fr>laveures</fr></m> to be
found in them. They are less likely to fall over as others that have a
flat foot.

<head>Against diarrhea and dysentery</head>

<ab>Against diarrhea, it is very good to use <m>preserve of
<pa>symphytum</pa></m>, also called <m><pa>consolida maior</pa></m>. And
if it is against dysentery, you can rub with it the <bp>temples</bp>,
the <bp>hollow of the hands</bp>, &amp; the <bp>sole of the feet</bp>
with <m>wax oil</m> &amp; take one <ms>drop</ms> or two of it with a
<tl><ms>spoonful</ms></tl> of <m>broth</m>. The <m>root of <pa>consolida
maior</pa></m>, <tl>pestled</tl> &amp; put between <del>pieces</del> cuts of
<m><al>beef</al></m> in one piece, then boiled, rejoins them, as one
says.
