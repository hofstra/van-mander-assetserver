<ab><al>Calandra<comment>c_049v_04</comment> larks</al> &amp; all
<al>birds</al> taken from the nest &amp; which have not had freedom are
better, for these which are taken by net never sing so well. However,
the savage ones give <del><ill/></del> much pleasure with their
chanting, but they ought be taken <ms><tmp>before Michaelmas</tmp></ms>,
otherwise they scarcely live. A small impostume occurs on all on the
fork of their tail, occasionally, which some call <df><fr>gaillardise</fr></df>,<comment>c_049v_06</comment>
which makes them sick &amp; sometimes makes them die, especially
<al>calandra larks</al>. One knows when they are sad &amp; do not sing.
One must pierce it <del><fr>av</fr></del>, not with a <tl>pin</tl>, but
very gently by turning with the tip of <tl>quite pointy feather</tl>.
The <al>calandra lark</al> does not want to be without <del>grey</del>
river sand, &amp; the grey is the best, a little coarse. It rubs itself in it
&amp; is purged by it.

<head>Grain of <m>lead</m></head>

<ab>Take a <del>pierced</del> <tl>playing card</tl>, pierced with a
<tl>pin</tl> or <tl>needle</tl>, folded on all four sides. Hold it with
the end of a small <tl>cleft stick</tl> and, holding the said
<tl>stick</tl> by the<del><fr>un bout</fr></del> <add>other</add> end,
put your <tl>card</tl> three or 4 <ms><bp>fingers</bp></ms> away from
the <m>water</m> that you will have put in a <tl>dish</tl> or similar
<tl>vessel</tl>. Then pour your <m>lead</m>, which should not be too
hot, into the <tl>card</tl> &amp; continually tap on the <tl>stick</tl>
that holds it. And thus your <m>lead</m> will turn into round grains.
And pass it through a coarse <tl>sieve</tl> to separate the largest grain
from the smallest. The largeish one will reach 25 to 30 <ms>paces</ms>.

<ab>Those that <del>can</del> are taken <tmp>at Michaelmas</tmp> are
good for keeping, but those that are taken in <tmp>March</tmp> die,
because they are starting to enter into love. <al><fr>Bénaris</fr></al>
are fed oats <tmp>all summer</tmp> in order that they are fed without
fattening, to be more appropriate for hunting &amp; taking the others.
Then, when one wants to fatten them for selling, one gives them
<pa><fr>millet</fr></pa>. They sing <tmp>at night</tmp>. One needs to
<del><fr>c</fr></del> take them <ms><tmp>after mid-July until
Michaelmas</tmp></ms>, for after that time that they have their young in
this country, they go like the <al>turtledoves</al>. <al>Siskins</al>
should also be taken <ms><tmp>from All Saints' Day until
Christmas</tmp></ms>, for after that they go to the <env>mountains</env> to
brood.
