<head>For gilding with <m>gold color</m> and <m>tinsel</m></head>

<ab>Once you have <del>gilded</del> <add>colored</add>, make your
stamped ornament in <m>tin</m><comment>c_007r_01</comment> as said, or
in <m>iron</m> <del><fr>dest</fr></del> or <m>copper</m>, one ought not
to put a layer of <m>glue</m> here as on <m>wood</m>, but take only
<m>fatty oil</m>, which is made in seven or eight <ms>days</ms> <env>in
the sun</env> with <m>walnut oil</m> and <m>lead white</m> <del>&amp;
with</del>, stirring it often, or cooking it on the fire if one is in
haste. Then, with the <m>oil</m> thus made fatty, grind a little <m>lead
white</m>, <m>massicot</m> &amp; <m><fr>mine de plomb</fr></m>
<del><ill/></del>, at discretion, as much of one as of the other.
<m>Minium</m> gives color to the <m>gold</m>. Next, with this, you make
a layer of it evenly on your stamp, taking care not to fill the hollows.
And once it is almost dry, lay the <m>gold</m> leaf on it with
<m>cotton</m>. Such <m>gold</m> will hold up <env>in the rain</env> on
houses &amp; elsewhere. And if you have gilded with <m>tinsel</m>, color
it with <m><fr>fumée de perdrix</fr></m> or from yellow or red
<m>cloth</m>, &amp; it will be beautiful like pure <m>gold</m>. You can
cover trunks, mirrors, canopies &amp; posts of beds of colored
<m>velvet</m> or <m>satin</m> and then apply the gilded stamped ornament
on them with <m>strong glue</m>.</ab>

<ab>The stamp of <m>sheets of copper or latten</m> is made on engraved &amp; cut
<m><pa>service tree</pa><comment>c_007r_02</comment> wood</m>, should you want to spend less. And next, the stamped object is
colored with the aforesaid colours of <m>lake</m>, <m>verdet</m>,
<m><fr>azur d’esmail</fr></m>, &amp; soak in <m>turpentine varnish</m>.
But in the place you want to <m>azure</m>, lay down <m><fr>fer
blanc</fr></m>, which is more appropriate for an <m>azure</m>
background.</ab>

<ab>It is made from <m><al>codfish</al> skin</m>, boiled rather than
being <m>salted</m>. <pro>Joiners</pro> <m>glue</m> their masterpieces
with it and <pro><mu>guitar</mu> makers</pro> use it for delicate works.
It needs to be strongly beaten, then soaked gently in <m>barely boiling
water</m>.</ab>

<ab><m><bp>Mouth</bp> glue</m> is made of <m>parchment scrapings</m> and
one uses it for <m>glueing</m> <m>paper</m> or similar things without
fire, wetting it with one's <tl><bp>mouth</bp></tl>.</ab>
