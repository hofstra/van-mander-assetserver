<head>Cross of the <pro>commanders of <pl>Malta</pl></pro></head>

<ab>This beautiful <m><fr>rouge clair</fr></m> which makes the field of
the white <m>enamel</m> cross is <del>blood</del> of fine tear of
<m><al>dragon</al>'s blood</m> tempered with <m>eau-de-vie</m>
or else <m><pl>Indian</pl> <fr>laque plate</fr></m>, which in my opinion is made
in <pl>Flanders</pl>, tempered with <m>clear turpentine</m> &amp; tear
of <m>mastic</m> &amp; laid down on a <m>silver</m> leaf, not the kind
which the <pro>painters</pro> use, but a thicker kind, which is
burnished by <pro>those who make <m>gemstone foils</m></pro>
<del><fr>Av</fr></del> or by <pro>goldsmiths</pro>, &amp; that gives it
this beautiful brilliance.</ab></div>

<head><m>Latten</m> and <m>calamine</m></head>

<ab><pro>Founders</pro> do not melt <m>latten</m> in a
<tl><del>air</del><add>bellow</add> furnace</tl> but in
<tl>crucibles</tl>, for in a <tl><add>bellow</add> furnace</tl> &amp;
amid the <m>charcoals</m>, the <m>calamine</m> would disappear.

<head><m>Metal</m></head>

<ab><m>Tin</m> should be pure for if there is any <m>lead</m>, it will
go up in smoke while melting. Mixed <m>tin</m> holds in the fire for a
long time but the <tl><m><fr>cendr√©e</fr></m></tl> separates
it.</ab></div>

<ab>If your <tl>retort</tl> is well luted one ought not to surround it
with <tl><m>ashes</m></tl>, which would only get in the way of chasing
the <m>spirits</m> properly. But when, at the end, you give it violent
fire, surround it with coals which should be lit elsewhere beforehand,
as those in the <tl>furnace</tl> should be, in order that they do not
crackle &amp; do not make smoke. Put the said lit coals around the body
of the <tl>retort</tl>, &amp; not close to the neck, which does not need
to be heated as vigorously. The <tl>top grate</tl>, where you place your
<tl>retort</tl>, is sufficiently far, one <ms><fr>dour</fr></ms> or
<ms>half a <ms>foot</ms></ms>, from the <tl>bottom grate</tl> where the
charcoal is placed, for by doing this not as much of it is
wasted.</ab></div>
